In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010. Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda. But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.\\n\\nOnly the UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy. The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development, while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU, the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010. Next week, the Commission will present revised proposals to meet the Lisbon goals. Many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.\",\n          \"BBC web search aids odd queries\\n\\nThe BBC's online search engine was used a record amount in 2004, helping with enquires both simple and strange.\\n\\nMore than 277 million enquiries were made, asking for informaton of a wide range of subjects. The most requested search terms of 2004 included games, EastEnders, CBBC, John Peel, Harry Potter and Olympics. But there were many strange enquiries, including: what is a dog?, how do you say basketball? and what is the biggest collection of naval fluff? The search engine works by matching key words typed in to different web pages but many people still type in natural language questions. Here are some of the strangest queries of 2004 - spelling and grammar errors left untouched - and their possible solutions:\\n\\n\\n - How to fold a serviette like an elf's boot? \\n \\n\\n\\n - How do I structure a French letter? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is better one long vacation each year or several short vacations throughout the year? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is so special about the Swiss? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What are the contemporary issue in nurses? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is the number 4 in this number 40052308090? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is up? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is the name of James Martin's dog? \\n \\n\\nSearch engines are key to the way people use the internet.

Men's champion Marat Safin remains fourth in the ATP rankings while beaten finalist Lleyton Hewitt replaces Andy Roddick as world number two. Roger Federer retains top spot, but Safin has overtaken Hewitt to become the new leader of the Champions Race. Alicia Molik, who lost a three-set thriller against Davenport in the quarter-finals, is in the women's top 10 for the first time in her career. Her rise means Australia have a player in the top 10 of the men's and women's rankings for the first time in 21 years.

The study, from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, does not praise the rough handling of oil company Yukos. But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police. \\\"An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,\\\" the authors say.\\n\\nThe paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company. The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. In the West, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.\\n\\nAfter Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, he did not raise taxes, but put a lot of effort - too much, critics argue - into enforcement.\\n\\nSince then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year. After Mr Putin came to power, the company's overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and Sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. But shareholders benefited hugely: Sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.\\n\\nDoes this analysis make sense? In part, certainly. For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. Companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. Foreign direct investment, long negligible, is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in Europe. But the authors' model does not quite cover all the complexities. For a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue. In fact, the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in Russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. Companies can, for example, persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.\\n\\nAnd the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western. Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. The case against Yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. As far as most commentators are concerned, the state is pursuing Yukos out of a political vendetta, rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. Since Yukos' founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the Russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.\",\n          \"Nintendo handheld given Euro date\\n\\nNintendo's new handheld console, the DS, will launch in Europe on 11 March, the company has announced.\\n\\nThe portable games machine, which features touch-screen control, will retail for \\u00a399 in the UK (149 euros). Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from \\u00a319 to \\u00a329. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.\\n\\nThe 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS.\\n\\nMore than 120 games are in development for the new console, Nintendo has said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS, with a \\\"download play\\\" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega's launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.\\n\\nThe launch price of \\u00a399 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. \\\"It's a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz,\\\" he says. \\\"However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example.\\\"\\n\\nMr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony's new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. \\\"The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony's attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far,\\\" Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts Screen Digest.\\n\\nIn the past, games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was \\\"pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch\\\". \\\"Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo,\\\" Mr Iwata added. Nintendo raised its sales targets for the DS console last December after selling a million in the US and Japan in just a few weeks.\",\n          \"Roddick into San Jose final\\n\\nAndy Roddick will play Cyril Saulnier in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday.\\n\\nThe American top seed and defending champion overcame Germany's Tommy Haas, the third seed, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. And Saulnier survived an injury scare in his semi-final with seventh-seeded Austrian Jurgen Melzer. The Frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame Melzer, who was left fuming over a series of line calls, 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3. \\\"I was feeling horrible earlier in the week,\\\" Roddick said. \\\"I thought tonight was another step in the right direction. \\\"On my returns, I was standing in more and I'm getting a little more depth, even if I don't hit a perfect return.\\\"\\n\\nRoddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set. But he broke straight back and then broke Haas again to lead 4-2. \\\"It's extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don't do anything with them,\\\" admitted Haas. \\\"I rushed a few backhands and he took advantage.\\\" Saulnier will move into the world's top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final. \\\"It's taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind,\\\" he revealed. \\\"Sometimes I didn't believe I could get to a final and now I am here. I've stayed mentally strong. \\\"I'm on the way. I'll keep fighting and work a lot and I'll be up there.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sport\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.\\n\\nTime Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL\\'s underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL\\'s existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\\n\\nTime Warner\\'s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts\\' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\\n\\nTimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann\\'s purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.',\n",

In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\'s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman\\'s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\'s taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He\\'s taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\\n\\nWorries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China\\'s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\'s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing\\'s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\'s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\'s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.',\n",

Yukos\\' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks.

But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.',\n",

Rod Eddington, BA\\'s chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA\\'s profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.\\n\\nTo help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.\\n\\nIn October, it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA\\'s estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.\\n\\nIt also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA\\'s latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA\\'s shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.',\n",

Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%. Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.\\n\\nPernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of £5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH. Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine. Allied Domecq's big names include Malibu rum, Courvoisier brandy, Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream. The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.\",\n",

The sooner the better for the state budget.\" The BBC\\'s correspondent in Jakarta, Rachel Harvey, told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. \"The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,\" she said. Indonesia\\'s previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.',\n",

The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.\\n\\nIn January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.\",\n",

Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n\\nPearson\\'s Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n\\nThe National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures.

They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike.

The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a \"bad piece of legislation\". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.\\n\\nHowever, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.\\n\\nThe EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to \\'bumping\\' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger\\'s will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.\\n\\nHowever, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to \"extraordinary circumstances\". Airlines fear that \"extraordinary circumstances\" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. \"It\\'s a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n\\nThe European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.\\n\\nEC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were \"grey areas\" but said \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out\". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA\\'s Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. \"We reckon it\\'s going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that\\'s over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,\" Mr Clarke said. \"That\\'s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. \"The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers\\' right.\" \"This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people\\'s daily lives,\" he added. The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.',\n",

There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China\\'s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China\\'s yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect.

              " {'sequence': 'Call centre users \\'lose patience\\'\\n\\nCustomers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.\\n\\nOnce past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an \\'always available\\' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling \\'on the move\\' using their mobile phones.\\n\\nThe surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres\\' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.\\n\\nIn what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer\\'s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.\\n\\nSuggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.\\n\\nThere are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:\\n\\n- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", \\n - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, \\n - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?',\n",

Advisors Goldman Sachs are understood to have valued its demerged Deluxe Film unit at £300m, the report added. Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September. Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios. The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.\\n\\nRank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. It also owns Deluxe Media, which makes and distributes DVDs and videos. However, that business is seen as less successful. Last year it made profits of £21.5m on a turnover of £392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to DVDs from VHS video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. A spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on Friday. Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to £170m from £194m last year. Formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading UK film producer and cinema owner for many years. It has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the UK - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. It now owns 34 Grosvenor casinos, the Mecca Bingo chain and more than 100 Hard Rock Cafes in 38 countries.\",\n",

The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn.

Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar\\'s weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.',\n",

The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n\\nMr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. \"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees,\" he told a Russian court.\\n\\nYugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.\\n\\nTexas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. \"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,\" Judge Clark said in her ruling. \"Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government.\" Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.\\n\\nIn her ruling, the judge acknowledged that \"it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law\". But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. The US court\\'s jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. Analysts said the ability of Gazprom and Rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of Yugansk remained unclear.\\n\\nYukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. However, it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues. \"We believe the merits of our case are strong and simple,\" said chief executive Steven Theede. \"Our assets were illegally seized.

This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\\n\\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.\",\n",

US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said.

Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. The new rules are the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, part of the US clean-up after corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom. Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules.

They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some, particularly the UK\\'s CBI, warned that companies would choose to let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. The latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday, just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced. \"I think this signifies a change of heart at the SEC,\" CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC\\'s Today programme. \"They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation really means: that they can\\'t make these rules in isolation.\" The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries. The European Union, in particular, was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted. \"I don\\'t underestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension will provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look at their internal controls,\" said Donald Nicolaisen, the SEC\\'s chief accountant.',\n",

His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\\n\\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan\\'s most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country\\'s leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\\n\\nMr Tsutsumi\\'s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn\\'t let me use the silk futon, saying it\\'s a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan\\'s troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank\\'s bad loans.',\n",

While the US economy is growing at a \"reasonably good pace\" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US.

If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,\" Mr Greenspan said.

He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.\\n\\nMeanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs.

The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. On Wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips Japan into recession.\\n\\nA previous estimate of 0.1% growth between July and September was downgraded to a 0.3% decline.

However, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. \"The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,\" said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka. Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. \"The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone,\" Mr Takenaka stressed.\\n\\nMinisters pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan\\'s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. Japan\\'s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. However, the economy\\'s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. \"The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn\\'t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,\" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

Japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year.\\n\\nGrowth slowed to 0.3% in the quarter ending September 30, down from 6.3% in the first quarter of 2004. Experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. \"The outlook for November is positive so I don\\'t think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in October,\" said a METI official. Despite the rise in unemployment, jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years. The comparatively weak economic date preyed on shares with the Nikkei down 1% in afternoon trade.',\n",

The airline said that when all these planes have been delivered, it will be able to carry more than 70 million passengers a year, making it Europe\\'s largest airline.

The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday\\'s announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production.\\n\\nSince its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.\\n\\nLast year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,\" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"The risk is that after they\\'ve invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,\" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.\\n\\nThe price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from £12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker\\'s. The consumers\\' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.\\n\\nThe Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.\\n\\nThere are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW\\'s Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory\\'s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.',\n",

However, Nestle\\'s profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\\n\\nNestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales.

Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.\\n\\nElsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth. Nestle added that it had performed strongly in Africa and Asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability.

Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together, it said. Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat's car business is making a loss.\\n\\nUnder the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. It considered floating Ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to Italian bank Mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). That sale valued Ferrari - which owns the Maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. Such a move would help Alfa Romeo and Maserati to share marketing, distribution and research & development costs. Maserati and Ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.\\n\\nFiat, Italy's largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes. Fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with General Motors. The US firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy Fiat outright. Analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which Fiat now had to develop the business.\",\n",

Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. Also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 GMT.\\n\\nThe government has been accused of underfunding R&D, making it harder for Italy to compete with other European nations and leading to a \"brain-drain\" of the country\\'s brightest talents. Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. As a result, they say, Italy\\'s corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. At the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy\\'s entrepreneurial spirit.\\n\\nThe government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy\\'s 60 million population. According to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy\\'s business newspaper, the government will focus on \"opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system\".\\n\\nMr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; £4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. He has also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. Italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility Enel. Critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make Italy\\'s problems worse. Limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.\\n\\nThe country has been one of the eurozone\\'s worst economic performers in recent years. Growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. At the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from Italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy\\'s economy to a juddering halt. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy\\'s economy.',\n",

The tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; £910m). Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. Spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. All the spending increases will run over the next three years.\\n\\nUnveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%.\\n\\nHe predicted that the South African economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. Mr Manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.\\n\\n\"In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,\" said Mr Manuel. He said that the economic situation was a \"marked improvement\" on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. About 280,000 jobs a year have been created in South Africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high, currently close to 30%.

              " {'sequence': 'Economy \\'stronger than forecast\\'\\n\\nThe UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\\n\\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\\n\\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\\n\\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\\n\\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year\\'s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"',\n",

As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\\n\\nThe FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries\\' access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\\n\\nAccording to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers.

The automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which can be bureaucratic. The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries.\\n\\nMr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. \"Foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,\" said Mr Nath, without specifying the timeframe.

Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.\\n\\nAnalysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world\\'s airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.\\n\\nIt is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing\\'s twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\\n\\n\"Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. But the 777-200LR \"is a niche player\", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.\\n\\nFor Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. It has been producing a rival to Boeing\\'s 777 line for more than a year. \"Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said Flight International\\'s Mr Learmount.\\n\\nBoth Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. These orders should help underpin the company\\'s profits. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract. Net profit was $186m (£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.',\n",

Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year. \"The economy is now heading upward rather than downward,\" said central bank governor Park Seung. \"The worst seems to have passed.\" Mr Park\\'s statement came as the bank decided to keep interest rates at an all-time low of 3.25%. It had cut rates in November to help revive the economy, but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in January - has stopped it from cutting further. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. Other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health. Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December. Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers\\' bad debts.

The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%, after a year of contraction in 2003, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward. Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. According to the statistics office, Destatis, rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand.\\n\\nBut the relentless rise in the value of the euro last year has also hit the competitiveness of German products overseas. The effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole, as well as Germany. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but senior officials at the rate-setting European Central Bank are beginning to talk about the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.

The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China\\'s CNPC.\\n\\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk\\'s former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\\n\\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\\n\\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country\\'s richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n\\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China\\'s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China\\'s thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it\\'s a good deal for them too.\"',\n",

The two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between Venezuelan energy firm PDVSA and Argentina's Enarsa. Under this deal, the Argentine market will be opened to Venezuelan investment. President Chavez added that Brazil's Petrobras could join soon the co-operation deal. President Chavez is an ardent promoter of the concept of a South American oil company, which could include the state-owned companies of Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia. The two presidents also agreed to create 'Television Sur', a Latin American network of state-owned television channels.\",\n",

The German company is to extend a planned production break at one of its plants due to the faulty Bosch part. The Dingolfing site will now be closed all next week instead of for just two days.

The faulty component does not represent a safety risk but causes the motor to stall after a significant amount of mileage. When asked if BMW would be seeking compensation from Bosch, the carmaker\\'s chief executive Helmut Panke said: \"we will first solve the problem before talking about who will pay\". Audi and Mercedes Benz were also supplied with the defective diesel fuel-injection pumps but neither of them have to recall any vehicles. A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, parent company of Mercedes Benz, said it will however have to halt some production. It is to close the Mercedes factory in Sindelfingen on Monday and Tuesday.

Yukos argued that since it had a US subsidiary and local bank accounts, the US court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of Yugansk. But Deutsche Bank - itself a target of a Yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank\\'s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in Houston. Its lawyer, Hugh Ray, told the court that Yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts opened by its new US subsidiary. By doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts. But he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after Yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 December, and then backdated.\\n\\nYukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point. He said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork, but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 December. Even so, he told the court that only $480,000 had been in the accounts that day, with the rest arriving a day later.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm Gazprom the money to bid for Yuganskneftegaz, as the Yukos unit is formally known. The sale went ahead, despite an order from the US bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. In the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm Rosneft. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia\\'s very profitable oil business back under state control.\\n\\nYukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia. It also said that in the event of going bust, it could offer the chance of restructuring. \"It gives us a kind of life after death alternative,\" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. Yukos is currently suing four companies - Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, Rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in Yugansk\\'s disposal. It has also threatened to sue the Russian government for $28bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos\\' legal wrangling as meaningless. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, once Russia\\'s richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.',\n",

Turkcell\\'s financial consolidation of Irancell\" because its stake would be reduced to less than 50%. \"If management control and financial consolidation of Irancell cannot be achieved... the realisation of the project will become risky,\" it warned in a statement. The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel, although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there. The two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004. Israeli industry minister Ehud Olmert was reported in June to have attended a meeting between Ruhi Dogusoy, Turkcell\\'s chief operating officer, and executives from Israeli telecoms firms. Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments, passed earlier in September. The other is airports, a source of controversy after the army closed Tehran\\'s new Imam Khomeini International Airport on its opening day in May 2004. Again, the allegation was that the part-Turkish TAV consortium which built and ran it had links with Israel.',\n",

Argentina defaulted on its debt three years ago, the biggest sovereign default in modern history. Yesterday Argentina\\'s economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, said that he estimated that the results of the restructuring would be ready around next Thursday (3 March). Argentina\\'s President, Nestor Kirchner, said on Friday: \"A year ago when we started the swap (negotiations), they told us we were crazy, that we were irrational.\" But he added that his government was close to achieving: \"The best debt renegotiation in history.\" The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years. If the offer does not go ahead, international lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved investors could follow but analysts are optimistic that it will go through, despite the tough terms for bondholders. About 70% to 80% of bondholders are expected to accept the terms of the offer. By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer. Sorting out its debt would enhance the country\\'s credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment. Of Argentina\\'s bondholders, 38.4% reside in Argentina, 15.6% in Italy, 10.3% in Switzerland, 9.1% in the United States, 5.1% in Germany and 3.1% in Japan. Investors in the UK, Holland and Luxembourg have about 1% each and the remainder were not broken down by country. The deal is likely to be taken up most enthusiastically by domestic investors, who will benefit if Argentina\\'s economy becomes more stable.',\n",

They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush\\'s administration had done little to stop the dollar\\'s slide. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November. Against the Japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.\\n\\nPolicy makers in Europe have called the dollar\\'s slide \"brutal\" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. However, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro\\'s rise at a monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday. Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of a four-nation EU visit, has applauded Ireland\\'s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. \"The eurozone is growing below its potential. When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,\" he said. Mr Snow\\'s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.\\n\\n\"Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,\" he explained. \"Markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.\" US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. Domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by President Bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (£230bn). The current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. For many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. \"No end is in sight,\" said Carsten Fritsch, a strategist at Commerzbank . \"It is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.\" Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.',\n",

In January, Marsh agreed to pay $850m to settle the suit - a figure in line with the placement fees it collected in 2003 - and agreed to change its business practices.

Government lawyers said they would ask the full US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to hear the case. The court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking. \"It\\'s pretty clear that they\\'ve suffered a severe setback,\" said Anthony Sebok, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, adding that the appeal was what the government \"would be expected to ask for\".\\n\\nProsecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. Among the firms accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime, and accused the firms of conspiring and running \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations\". The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. They also said that they have met many of the government\\'s demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement hammered out in 1998 with 46 states. A three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.\\n\\nCentral to the government\\'s case was a meeting in the Plaza Hotel, New York, on 15 December, 1953. Prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. Despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness, the companies have modified their stances in recent years. Altria\\'s Philip Morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the company\\'s main lawyer William Ohlemeyer told the BBC last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest. Government lawyers have until 21 March to file their appeal.',\n",

Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over £1.5bn of lost sales to generics but still managing to grow the business. \"The continuing success of our key products means we can now look forward to a good performance in 2005,\" he said. \"2005 will also be an important year in terms of research and development pipeline progress.\" However, the firm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, known as \\'771, after disappointing clinical trial results. Glaxo is relying on new treatments for conditions such as cancer, diabetes, depression, HIV/AIDS and allergies to lift the pace of sales growth after several disappointing years.',\n",

Mercedes-Benz\\'s woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.\\n\\nMercedes\\' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003\\'s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes\\' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.\\n\\nThe carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes\\' position as the world\\'s most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler\\'s shares fell 1.5% on the news. \"While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,\" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.\\n\\nIn contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.\\n\\nOverall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler\\'s strong performance helped the world\\'s fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.\\n\\n\"The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,\" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler\\'s chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler\\'s profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting \"significant improvements\" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.',\n",

But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month\\'s economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week\\'s inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\\n\\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\\n\\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\\n\\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC\\'s widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"',\n",

The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world\\'s fourth-largest cocoa producer.\\n\\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\\n\\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world\\'s second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world\\'s leading cocoa grower.',\n",

US companies created twice as many jobs as expected in October while exports hit record levels in September. Analysts said a clear-cut victory for President Bush in last week\\'s election paved the way for a rise. Another rise could be in store for December, some economists warned.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s Open Market Committee - which sets interest rate policy in the US - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise. The Fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rises in June, August and September.\\n\\nThe Central Bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. The Fed did not rule out raising rates once again in December but noted that any future increases would take place at a \"measured\" pace. In a statement, the Fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained \"well contained\" while the US economy appeared to be \"growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices\". Financial analysts broadly welcomed the Fed\\'s move and shares traded largely flat. The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 0.89 points, or 0.01%, at 10,385.48.\\n\\nRecent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the US economy.

The economy grew 3.7% in the third quarter, slower than forecast, but an improvement on the 3.3% growth seen in the second quarter. Analysts claimed the Fed\\'s assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in December.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter\\'s energy price drag before concluding that the Fed has more work to do in 2005,\" said Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at CIBC World Markets.\\n\\n\"I think the Federal Reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate,\" said Sung Won Sohn, chief US economist for Wells Fargo Bank. \"The economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics, employment and the price of oil,\" he added. The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy.

In a report published on Wednesday, the Bank said that with rates at their current level, inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years.

At 1405 GMT, shares in Barclays were trading down 0.67% at 590 pence. \"The headline numbers are in line, but the story is costs,\" said analyst Alex Potter at Lehman Brothers. \"They are a bit more aggressive than we had expected. The cost overshoot is not in Barclays Capital but in the UK bank.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Yukos owner sues Russia for $28bn\\n\\nThe majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\\n\\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos\\' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\\n\\nThe Russian government\\'s argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit\\'s full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\\n\\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos\\' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government\\'s actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\\n\\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government\\'s action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\\n\\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.',\n",

Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off. Under the agreement, the state will get a controlling share of Gazprom in exchange for Rosneft. The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade. Speaking on NTV television, which is controlled by Gazprom, Mr Miller added that Yugansk, which was swallowed up by Rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state-owned oil firm headed by current Rosneft chief Sergei Bogdanchikov. According to reports from Russian News Agency Interfax, the deal should go through in the next two to three months.\\n\\n\"Obtaining majority control over Gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares,\" Mr Miller added. By opening up trading in Gazprom to foreigners, the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders. Currently, foreigners can only trade in Gazprom via a small issue of London-listed proxy shares. \"This is positive news for the international investment community,\" Global Asset Management investment chief David Smith said. \"The majority of investors are going to be happy,\" he added.\\n\\nHowever, analysts were disappointed that Yugansk would not be included in the deal. \"Yugansk is a heavy cashflow generator and would have been a much better asset for Gazprom,\" Renaissance Capital energy analyst Adam Landes told Reuters news agency. But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom. \"Ultimately and industrially, Gazprom needs Yugansk,\" he added. Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of 8% of Russia\\'s total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk. However, the merged group will still remain outside Russia\\'s top five oil producers - led by Lukoil with 11% of the market , followed by TNK-BP which is half owned by BP, and Surgutneftegaz. Instead, the merged Gazprom-Rosneft group will rank alongside Sibneft with 7% of the market. Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in December, following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on Yukos. The shell company was then snapped up by Rosneft. Yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the US courts. The unit was auctioned by Russian authorities to help pay off a $27.5bn back-tax bill.',\n",

The Commission\\'s decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne. But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.\\n\\nThe Commission\\'s controversial 2002 ruling gave \"protected designation of origin\" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.\\n\\nFrom 2007 onwards, Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products. The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. \"In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,\" Hans Arne Kristiansen, a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board, told the BBC. Denmark is Europe\\'s second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece. It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie. \"It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation,\" Mr Kristiansen said. \"That is just one of the costs.\"\\n\\nThe case will also have a major impact on Britain\\'s sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses.\\n\\nJudy Bell, the company\\'s founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. \"If we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,\" she said. \"We have never tried to pull the wool over anyone\\'s eyes - it\\'s very clear from the label that it\\'s Yorkshire feta.\" The original decision was a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years. Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat\\'s milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine. Greece makes 115,000 tonnes, mainly for domestic consumption.

But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. The government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled.\\n\\nMs Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed. \"We will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands.\"\\n\\nA day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. The list \"will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion\", he said. An open-ended list could further damage outside investors\\' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia, Mr Hensel said. As a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. \"They\\'re aware of the need not to scare investors, and to be careful of internal divides within Ukraine,\" he said. \"They don\\'t want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set.\" Foreign investment in Ukraine, at about $40 a head in 2004, is one of the lowest among ex-Soviet states.\\n\\nMr Yushchenko became president after two elections in December, the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests.\\n\\nHis opponent, Viktor Yanukovich, still has huge support in the country\\'s eastern industrial heartland. Mr Yushchenko\\'s administration has accused its predecessor, led by ex-President Leonid Kuchma, of corruption. The privatisation review\\'s number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma\\'s son-in-law, for $800m (£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. The mill, Krivorizhstal, is one of the world\\'s most profitable. \"We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,\" Mr Yushchenko told an investors\\' conference in Kiev.\\n\\nOne of the jilted bidders, Netherlands-based group LNM, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market.\\n\\n\"If the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest,\" a spokesman told BBC News.

              " {'sequence': 'Why few targets are better than many\\n\\nThe economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world\\'s leading economy by 2010.\\n\\nBut the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn\\'t become a global economic laggard. They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia, India and China, as well as with the economic might of the United States. That\\'s why there was a tone of urgency in the report, out on Wednesday, by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok. Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. His conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.\\n\\nLisbon risks becoming a \"synonym for missed objectives and failed promises\", his report said. \"The status quo is not an option.\"\\n\\nAt risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society Europe has built, it said. The report comes at a time when Europe\\'s competitive position is waning. The EU\\'s economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe, productivity lags behind that of the US. But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far. That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.\\n\\nAs Mr Kok\\'s report noted: \"The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\" \"The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.\"\\n\\nThe circumstances weren\\'t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000. Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so-called \"knowledge-based economy\". \"The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group. \"What you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. You find trade unions fighting change. But also the employers\\' associations. \"Even though they tell you they\\'re in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity.\"\\n\\nBut part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago. Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report. Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea. The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.\\n\\n\"Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the Kok report said. \"Everybody is responsible and thus no one.\" That\\'s why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. It also recommends that the European Commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they\\'re taking towards meeting the targets, effectively \"naming, shaming and faming\". \"Rhetoric and delivery don\\'t necessarily go hand in hand,\" Mr Kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. \"We don\\'t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.\"\\n\\nOn one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy. The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. In that sense, the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. \"It\\'s very ambitious,\" said John Palmer, political director at the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based think-tank. \"This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. It\\'s going to require quite new and innovative policies.\" But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn\\'t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality. For example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. But it doesn\\'t say how companies should be convinced to do this. It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, to adopt Mr Kok\\'s recommendations and press them on EU governments. Mr Barroso has said that the EU\\'s competitiveness will be his top priority. He expects his five-year term in office to be judged on Europe\\'s success in meeting the Lisbon agenda.',\n",

It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.\\n\\nGM\\'s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory\\'s closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM\\'s planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group\\'s new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group\\'s Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM\\'s cuts.\\n\\nNeither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab\\'s failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment\\'s leaders do not agree.\\n\\nGM\\'s plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.\\n\\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab\\'s losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said.\\n\\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers\\' perceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.',\n",

Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday.

Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days.

Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year.

The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market. At the same time, the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low, official Bank of England figures have shown.\\n\\nNationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier. \"We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared,\" said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister. There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004. In November, Barclays, which owns former building society the Woolwich, forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005, followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007. And last summer, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009.\\n\\nThe price of an average UK property now stands at £152,879. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said. He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.\\n\\n\"I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market. We always thought we would see a small rise, they thought they would see a small decline.\" House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. This is slightly above the 0-5% range Nationwide predicts.\\n\\nFurther evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday. New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said. The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995. The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004.

It comes just weeks ahead of the Budget and an expected general election. Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.\"\\n\\nA review by the ONS found it had made a mistake by \"double counting\" some spending on roads since 1998/9. Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his \"golden rule\" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget.\\n\\nThe changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total. Mr Letwin said: \"This is a very murky area... There will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled.\" The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10.5bn \"black hole\" in the nation\\'s coffers. But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.\\n\\nIn January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year\\'s Budget.

Shell's agreement, under the name Qatargas-4, foresees the building of new facilities to handle 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas, and 7.8 million tonnes of LNG each year from 2011 onwards.\",\n",

The priority for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government\\'s Communist allies onside. But his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit, which he said would be 4.5% of GDP in the year to March 2005. The country\\'s overall deficit is thought to be more than 10%, if the spending of India\\'s 35 states and territories is included. Under the fiscal responsibility law, Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year, a target he says he has now met for the current year.\\n\\nBut the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%, Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new law\\'s requirement. \"I was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act,\" he said. The following year, though, would have to be back on track, he warned.\\n\\n\"I may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means,\" he said. The coming year\\'s reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in India\\'s burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system, although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget.\\n\\nPresenting his budget in the lower house of parliament, Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. He said India\\'s economy grew 6.9% in 2004. In his budget Mr Chidambaram has:\\n\\n- Increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn) \\n - Increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn) \\n - Announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure \\n - Pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims \\n - Increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30% \\n - Announced a package for the sugar industry\\n\\nIn addition, up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country\\'s foreign exchange reserves, keeping budgeted spending under control. \"Given the resilience of the Indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty,\" Mr Chidambaram said. \"The whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty.\" The new Indian government, led by the Congress Party, was voted into power last May after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a \"human face\".\\n\\nThe finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming India\\'s tax system while expanding the tax base. As part of his reforms he has announced:\\n\\n- Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials \\n - Expanded service tax net \\n - Raised the income-tax threshold to 100,000 rupees ($2,300) \\n - Reduced income tax for those earning less than 250,000 rupees ($5,700) to 20% \\n - Reduced corporate tax rates to 30%\\n\\nAn annual economic survey released on Friday said India needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment, reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth. But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. The Communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will. In recent months, they have expressed their displeasure at the government\\'s economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation. In his last budget, Mr Chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers.',\n",

But Fiat\\'s heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. Fiat\\'s shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 GMT to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7% in early trading. \"We now have absolute freedom to design our own future,\" said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.\\n\\nAnalysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days. The firm is Italy\\'s largest private employer, and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy. For its part, GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.\\n\\n\"We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat,\" said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.\\n\\nThe Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright. German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm, but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control. Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a \"put option\" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share. As a result, the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians - and much worse for GM, which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GM\\'s stake to 10%.',\n",

Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case. The contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, was cancelled last year.\\n\\nThe Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun\\'s role in the procurement process. Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon. She subsequently joined the company in January 2003. Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.\\n\\nIn documents filed in a Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears\\' sentencing, prosecutors blamed Boeing\\'s senior management for failing to ask key questions about the \"legal and ethical issues\" surrounding Ms Druyun\\'s appointment. Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing. However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against Ms Druyun came to light.\\n\\nBoeing\\'s corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work.',\n",

The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.\\n\\nShareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.\\n\\nMCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC's AT&T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.\",\n",

But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university\\'s index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor\\'s 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\\n\\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\\n\\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\\n\\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor\\'s. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won\\'t stick\".',\n",

The four companies named in the law suit are gas giant Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, investment company Baikal, and state oil firm Rosneft. Yukos submitted the suit in Houston, where it filed for bankruptcy. As well as suing for damages, Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator. It also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\\n\\nThe clash between Yukos and the Kremlin came to a head last year when Yukos was hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines. To settle the bill, Russia forced Yukos to sell off Yuganskneftegas.\\n\\nYukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. It also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets. Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless. In Houston, bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 February to hear arguments on whether a US court is the proper forum for the case.\\n\\nThe threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however. Concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, Gazprom and Gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and Yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm Baikal Finance Group. A few days later, Baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.\",\n",

The figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter, but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. The increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year. \"It was a little softer than the consensus, but not a real surprise,\" said Gary Thayer, an economist at AG Edwards & Sons.

However, President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US.\\n\\nThe weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said. \"The economy regained some traction in the third quarter, but the growth is not robust,\" AG Edwards\\' Thayer. \"I think that means the Fed can take its time raising rates.

Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. Both are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature.\\n\\nHeineken\\'s net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; £371m) during 2004, from 798m euro a year ago.

Despite the dip in profits, Heineken\\'s sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in \"aggressive\" and \"high-impact\" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005. Heineken, which also owns the Amstel and Murphy\\'s stout brands, said it would also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries.\\n\\nHeineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit.\\n\\nCarlsberg, the world\\'s fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries.

It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way. This is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies.

GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging, then this trade can be substantially reduced. The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit, as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade.

The Indian firm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos. It is reported to be keen on buying a 15% stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft.\\n\\nRussian media reported that India and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India\\'s petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar.\\n\\nThe agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia. ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea.\\n\\nIndia is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year.\\n\\nONGC\\'s Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year. \"At current oil and gas prices, our cash flow situation is good,\" he told Reuters. \"What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money. \"The investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so.\"\\n\\nRussian news agencies reported that India\\'s petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at a meeting on Tuesday. ONGC\\'s Mr Raha declined to be drawn on his firm\\'s reported interest in the company. However, he stressed that ONGC was not interested in a \\'loan-for-oil deal\\' in connection to Yugansk, similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and China\\'s National Petroleum Corporation. \"China\\'s problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. We do not. We would like long-term security through equity participation.\" It is thought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until a US court has decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection. Yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk, auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill. It has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary.',\n",

At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth. \"[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,\" he said. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.\\n\\nAnalysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. \"[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,\" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. \"Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late.\" Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. That is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.',\n",

But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern English towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Like northern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Beck-Crespel is a specialist steel firm in Armentieres, about 20 miles from Lille. The company has not laid off a worker since 1945. It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in Europe these days.\\n\\nDirector Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in China and India. \"In our business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged European Union, (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,\" he says. It isn\\'t just globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. But at least there is still a steel industry. Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. New business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.\\n\\nThat is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille.\\n\\n\"In the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas it is 15%. They don\\'t see what Europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,\" he says. Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. Much of that trade passes through the world\\'s largest port, Rotterdam, in Holland, home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec. Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed, but Huisman Itrec is now setting up a factory in China, where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.\\n\\nBoss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. \"In the US growth is something like 6%, in China they are estimating 15%, and in the EU it is more or less 1%,\" he says. Mr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand. He much preferred the old currencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each country\\'s economic performance. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. In Britain that would be a bad year; in Germany it is one of the best in recent years. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone\\'s economy, this is a major problem. If Germany doesn\\'t once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. However, at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing.\\n\\nThe Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff. Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to Hungary. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity \"by nearly 30%\". But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. \"Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,\" he says. The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. Four years into that process, and the target seems further away than ever.',\n",

Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCI\\'s board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizon\\'s bid. Formerly known as Worldcom, MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. Shares of MCI were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of New York markets.\\n\\nQwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. \"We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI,\" the letter from Qwest said. Verizon\\'s offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI. Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. Both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizon\\'s.\\n\\nThe takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. There may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. Verizon is far bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Also, MCI, while trading under the name Worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'US regulator to rule on pain drug\\n\\nUS food and drug regulators will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days. The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx. Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval. The FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.\\n\\nPutting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said.\\n\\nMerck voluntarily stopped sales of Vioxx on 30 September, a move which caused the firm\\'s fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (£581m), from $1.4bn a year earlier. Merck\\'s shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation. Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. The Cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.\\n\\nPfizer is still selling its Celebrex and Bextra products, though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. Merck\\'s announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise. Merck\\'s head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx \"based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies\". He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. \"Given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US,\" Mr Kim explained.\\n\\nOn Thursday, David Graham from the FDA\\'s Office of Drug Safety told the advisory panel that \"there really doesn\\'t appear to be a need for Cox-2\" inhibitors. According to calculations presented to the US Senate by Dr Graham in November, Vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56,000 American deaths. Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case, the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. European regulators, meanwhile, ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitors. The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be \"cautious\" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.',\n",

That meant Moscow would not have to adhere to US rulings in the Yukos case. Yukos says a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has a US subsidiary and local bank accounts.\\n\\nYukos made its surprise Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Houston in December in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of Yugansk, its main oil producing unit, by Russian authorities. Yugansk was sold to help pay off a $27.5bn (£14.5bn) back tax bill. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously unknown group, which was in turn bought by state-controlled oil company Rosneft. The US court\\'s jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in a US court because Yukos has no assets in the US, apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston owned by its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore. Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan Gazpromneft the money to bid for Yugansk. US bankruptcy judge Letitia Clark, who issued an injunction in December to try and prevent the Yugansk sale, has said she will rule \"pretty promptly, however I do not anticipate ruling on it before next Tuesday\".\\n\\nYukos has claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. It has claimed that Russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of Yugansk as part of a campaign to destroy Yukos and its former owner Mihkail Khodorkovsky, who is facing a 10-year prison term in Russia for fraud and tax evasion. Yukos\\' parent company, the Gibraltar-based Menatep Group, is suing Russia in Europe for $28.3bn in financial damages. The company is also seeking $20bn in a separate US lawsuit against Rosneft and Gazprom for their role in the sale of Yugansk.',\n",

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about £10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. According to NIESR, if the government\\'s current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is \"unlikely\" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to \"50/50\". Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said.\\n\\nThe report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown\\'s forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.\\n\\nIt claimed revenues were likely to be £6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was \"on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond\". \"Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable.\" Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.\\n\\nIt said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the \"world economy will continue to grow strongly\". Global gross domestic product (GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan. Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone \"is expected to pick up speed\".\\n\\nGrowth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. \"Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,\" NIESR said, adding that \"the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery\". GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR said, was the UK\\'s much analysed and fretted over property market.',\n",

Cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in Cuba, will be affected. Critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards, reflecting the Cuban president\\'s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. In a live television broadcast announcing the measure, President Castro\\'s chief aide said it was necessary because of the United States\\' increasing \"economic aggression\". \"The ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the US government to suffocate our country,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on Cuba in recent months. President Bush\\'s government, which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba, introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May.\\n\\nCubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castro\\'s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. \"I think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash,\" says Jose Barrionuevo, head of strategy for Latin American emerging markets for Barclays Capital. \"It underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue.\"\\n\\nThe tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. This money, known as remittances, can amount to as much as $1bn a year. Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax. Their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax, such as euros, or increase their dollar payments to compensate. However, many of Cuban\\'s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. The tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit Cuba every year, particularly those Americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.\\n\\nCuba\\'s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and, according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, is now worth $3bn to the country.\\n\\nThe tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cuba\\'s cash-strapped economy. Cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food, fuel and medicine. Much of Cuba\\'s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. In recent weeks, Cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. Cuba\\'s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the Soviet Union forced it to embrace foreign capital, decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. However, a decline in foreign tourism since 2002, periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government\\'s economic problems. The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, Mr Barrionuevo said. \"The main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries, like Venezuela, which have restrictions on capital,\" he says. Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity. \"It is intended to be a permanent measure but I am not sure it can last too long.\"',\n",

Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts.\\n\\n\"The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,\" the firm said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost.\\n\\nThere are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. However, not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal. \"This is a very expensive acquisition,\" Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, told Reuters. \"I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure.\"',\n",

MCI\\'s directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders \"of maximum value\".\\n\\nAccording the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an \"\"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate\" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon\\'s offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. Friday\\'s lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI\\'s network, assets and clients. MCI\\'s directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.\\n\\nIn 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn.',\n",

Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq. Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the \"tightest\" so far.\\n\\nAt the heart of the administration\\'s fifth budget, presented to Congress on Monday, is an austere package of domestic measures. These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation.\\n\\nSuch belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush\\'s first term. Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was \"fair and responsible\". \"It is not something we have done with a meat axe, nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society,\" he said. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit. The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005.\\n\\nEducation, environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009.\\n\\nMost controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation\\'s poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase, although not by as much as originally planned. President Bush\\'s proposals would see the Pentagon\\'s budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.\\n\\nThe budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.\\n\\nAlso not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration\\'s radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress, the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months.\\n\\nJohn McCain, a Republican Senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit. \"With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,\" he said. However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009. \"The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes,\" he said.',\n",

It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.\\n\\nWith-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.\\n\\nJohn Gill, managing director of the insurer\\'s life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only \"partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002\". In addition, low interest rates meant that \"long-term investment returns are well below historic levels\", Mr Gill added. However, Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. \"Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods,\" he said.

The plan was put forward by G7 finance ministers over the weekend. The price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in Asia, before rebounding slightly in early European trading.\\n\\nIMF boss Rodrigo Rato was asked by G7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.\\n\\nHe is expected to present his conclusions at an IMF meeting in Washington during April. \"Whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the April IMF meetings,\" said John Reade, an analyst at UBS. The IMF values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce, a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal\\'s current market value. The IMF has 3,217 tonnes of gold, or about 113.5m ounces. Bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the IMF\\'s balance sheet, giving it more money to distribute.\\n\\nThis idea has been put forward before, but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty. \"This is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a G7 communiqu&#233; for achieving debt relief,\" said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.

According to the FT, the regulator has been annoyed by Rover's decision to talk publicly about the deal and the intense speculation which has ensued about what it will mean for Rover's future. As a result, hopes that approval of the deal may be fast-tracked have disappeared, the paper said. There has been continued speculation about the viability of Rover's Longbridge plant because of falling sales and unfashionable models.\\n\\nAccording to the Observer, 3,000 jobs - out of a total workforce of 6,500 - could be lost if the deal goes ahead. The paper said that Chinese officials believe cutbacks will be required to keep the MG Rover's costs in line with revenues. It also said that the production of new models through the joint venture would take at least eighteen months. Neither Rover nor Shanghai Automotive commented on the reports.\",\n",

The Adam Smith Lecture celebrates the author of 1776\\'s Wealth of Nations, which became a bible of capitalism. Dr Greenspan was invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown, whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church. Mr Brown introduced Dr Greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the \"the world\\'s greatest economist\". Dr Greenspan, 79, who has been in the UK to attend the G7 meeting in London, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith, whose genius he compared to that of Mozart.\\n\\nHe said the philosopher was a \"towering contributor to the modern world\". \"Kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of Adam Smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared. \"I am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor\\'s renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area.\" He continued: \"Smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked. \"In so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living.\"\\n\\nDr Greenspan said Smith\\'s revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. \"The incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the Enlightenment - especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,\" he said. Following his lecture, Dr Greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the Queen at Balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He later opened an exhibition dedicated to Smith in the atrium of Fife College of Further and Higher Education. Joyce Johnston, principal of the college, said: \"It is very fitting that the world\\'s premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world\\'s first economist.\" Dr Greenspan - who became chairman of the Federal Reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in June 2004 - will step down in January next year. He has served under Presidents George W Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Ronald Reagan. He was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to Gerald Ford.',\n",

The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\\n\\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO\\'s output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling\\'s strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\"',\n",

European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\\n\\nThe Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.\\n\\nFirms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\". There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.\\n\\nThe 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.\\n\\n\"We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without turning the US market into \"one with no exit\", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act\\'s least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm\\'s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (£374m).\\n\\nA delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.\\n\\nIt was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UK\\'s Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (£558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.',\n",

He said that while he understood that Ukraine was not ready for EU membership, the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements. \"We deserve an honest response,\" Mr Rybachuk told the Associated Press in an interview. \"We understand the difficulties.

US gaming consortium BLB will pay $339m (£182.5m) for the US unit, although the deal is subject to certain conditions.

Wembley said that, once the deal was completed, it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders. \"Whilst the completion of the sale of the US Gaming Division remains subject to a number of conditions, we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders,\" said Wembley chairman Claes Hultman.

In a statement, the club said it would allow Mr Glazer \"limited due diligence\" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid. But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazer\\'s plans, calling his assumptions \"aggressive\" and his plan \"damaging\". Many of Manchester United\\'s supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer. About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago.\\n\\nRival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday.\\n\\nManchester United\\'s response comes as little surprise, as the board made clear. \"Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal,\" the club said in its statement. Should it become a firm offer, it should be at a price that \"the board is likely to regard as fair\" and on terms which \"may be deliverable\". But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer\\'s proposal. \"The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer\\'s business plan assumptions are aggressive,\" the statement said, \"and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.\" Whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms, in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them Manchester United\\'s second biggest shareholders. They own the successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team based in Florida. If the family makes a formal offer, they will need the support of the club\\'s biggest shareholders.\\n\\nIrish horse racing millionaires JP McManus and John Magnier own 29% of United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression, and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.\\n\\nA group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds. They have signed a House of Commons motion, and Tony Lloyd, the Manchester Central MP, whose constituency includes the club\\'s Old Trafford ground, has pledged to take the matter \"to Tony Blair if necessary\". The Commons motion says \"any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football\". However, the DTI has dismissed the proposal. A spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. Mr Glazer\\'s offer values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). Pitched at 300p per share, it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon, which was rejected out of hand. Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday, down 3.75p on the day.',\n",

Life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years. But if measured at age 65 instead, the PPI said, a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years. The PPI\\'s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.\\n\\nThe government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies. Chris Curry, PPI research director, said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged. \"Even people in social class V [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age,\" he said. Researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women, who on average live longer than men.',\n",

The introduction of \\'chip and pin\\' cards has tightened security for transactions on the High Street. But the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, Retail Decisions said.\\n\\nThe introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number, instead of a signature. Retail Decisions chief executive Carl Clump told the BBC that there was \"no doubt\" that chip and pin would \"reduce card fraud in the card-present environment\". \"However, it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet, mail order, telephone order and interactive TV,\" he said. \"We have seen a 22% uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the UK... since the start of the year. \"Fraud doesn\\'t just disappear, it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain,\" he said.\\n\\nRetail Decisions\\' survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system, but that banks\\' performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy, at best. \"The main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need,\" said Mr Clump. Nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1,000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. Of these, 83% were happy with the experience, though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. However, only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary \\'chip\\' technology from all their card providers. Furthermore, 16% said that none of their cards had been replaced, while 30% said only some had. UK shoppers spent £5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003, the last full year for which figures are available from the Association of Payment Clearing Services (Apacs). Altogether, card scams on UK-issued cards totalled £402.4m in 2003. Card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6% to £116.4m, making it the biggest category even then. Within this, internet fraud totalled £43m, Apacs\\' figures show.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Firms pump billions into pensions\\n\\nEmployers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year, research suggests.\\n\\nA survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services\\' (IDS) said employer contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%. Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more, IDS said. Many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open, because of rising costs and increased liabilities. A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.\\n\\nThe rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes. These are less risky for employers. Under money purchase schemes, employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement.\\n\\nIDS said there were some schemes in good health.\\n\\nBut, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle \"yawning deficits\". The level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. In 1998/99, for example, contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. In contrast, between 1996 and 1998, some employers cut their contribution levels. Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in contributions was \"staggering\" and the highest ever recorded by IDS. \"We have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision,\" said Ms Sudell. \"With figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.\"',\n",

The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\\n\\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO\\'s output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling\\'s strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\"',\n",

Some 37 countries could benefit after a case-by-case review by bodies including the World Bank and the IMF, he said. But the US says it cannot support Mr Brown\\'s International Finance Facility to boost aid to developing countries. BBC correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the UK\\'s ambitions, but much work was needed. Mr Brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - \"the vast bulk\" of money owed by the poorest countries.\\n\\n\"We could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries, built up over 20 or 30 years, debts that are simply unpayable in the real world, are finally taken care of,\" he said. He added: \"It is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor.\" But he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency, tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. BBC correspondent Patrick Bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. Oxfam senior policy adviser Max Lawson welcomed the statement and said G7 ministers had \"passed the first hurdle of 2005\".\\n\\nBut he added: \"They need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world\\'s poorest. \"Two million children will die needlessly between now and the next meeting in April. If rich countries are going to keep their promises to tackle obscene poverty they need deliver - and deliver quickly.\" Talks are continuing on how to finance increased overseas development assistance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is to look at a proposal to use its gold supplies to help the debt relief effort when it meets in April. Mr Brown said G7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005. But UK plans for an International Finance Facility (IFF) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed. Mr Brown wanted to provide $10bn (£5.38bn) a year over a decade, using G7 backing so the money could be borrowed up front on financial markets.\\n\\nIt is a key element of his proposals for a modern version of the Marshall Plan, which brought US aid to rebuild Europe after World War II, for the developing world. Mr Brown said it was \"winning support every day\" and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the G8 summit in July. But US Treasury Under-Secretary John Taylor said the US could not support the IFF because of its \"legislative process\". \"The US is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that,\" he said. \"But this particular mechanism does not work for the United States. It works for other countries, and that is fine.\" Earlier, he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme the US had increased support for Africa in the past four years from $1.1bn per year to $4.6bn per year. But South Africa Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told the BBC\\'s Talking Point programme what was needed was one approach, with all wealthy nations on board. He said much of the money pledged by the US had not yet been dispensed.\\n\\nThe UK has made poverty in the poorest nations a key theme for its 2005 presidency of the Group of Eight (G8), which comprises the G7 and Russia. The G8 countries will meet at Gleneagles in Scotland. At a dinner on Friday night, former South African president Nelson Mandela backed Mr Brown\\'s plan when he urged the finance chiefs to write-off African debt and provide an extra $50bn (£26.69bn) a year in aid for the next decade. Talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of China and India, the US budget and trade deficits, how the US, Europe and Japan can act to boost global economic growth, and HIV/Aids. G7 ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said \"excess volatility\" would impede economic growth. Representatives from China, India, Russia, South Africa and Brazil were invited to attend some of the sessions. A G8 summit is set to take place in July.',\n",

Reports have put the offer at 300p per share, which would value Manchester United at about £800m ($1.5bn). The approach by the 76-year-old owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team is reportedly being led by his two sons, Avi and Joel. A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. However, the BBC has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.\\n\\nMr Glazer\\'s previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed \"not... in the best interests of the company\" by Manchester United\\'s board when they rejected his approach last year. However, Mr Glazer\\'s latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m.\\n\\nWhile United\\'s board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazer\\'s latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.\\n\\nSupporters\\' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer\\'s campaign - said it would fight any move. \"Manchester United are a debt-free company. We don\\'t want to fall into debt and we don\\'t need to fall into debt,\" Shareholders United\\'s Sean Bones told the BBC. United\\'s players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. \"A lot of people want the club\\'s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart,\" Rio Ferdinand told BBC Radio Five Live. \"No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.\"\\n\\nThe key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of United\\'s largest shareholders, the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus. Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. Mr Glazer owns 28.1%. Joe McLean, a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was \"utterly crucial\". \"Mr Glazer\\'s bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. \"If that\\'s the case, the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence, maybe 305. \"If that\\'s the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead.\"\\n\\nIndeed it is. Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003. In February 2004 he said he was \"considering\" whether to bid for the club. No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a \"preliminary approach\", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. However, the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. At the club\\'s annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. Legal adviser Maurice Watkins, commercial director Andy Anson and non-executive director Philip Yea were voted out, against the wishes of chief executive David Gill. But the move led to bankers JP Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick withdrawing from the Glazer bid team.',\n",

This week, we're hearing from Marianne Petersen, who is planning to convert a barn in Sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. Click on the link under her photograph to read her story, and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. And if you want to take part in the series, go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch.\\n\\nWorking from home presents a multitude of challenges. Understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. Do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others? Are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done? Do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver?. In order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. It may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit, and to keep strict office hours. Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. It is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours, keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. Isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out, and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. Joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. It is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases, they have to be resurrected.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability. It appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.\\n\\nIdeally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. This would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. It is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. Ideally, it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. The walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour. The owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. I would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. As for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. Use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn.\\n\\nThe layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. Large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. The finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting, while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house, your plan of going wireless is sensible. A wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless LAN card in the PC in the renovated area may be sufficient. However, important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass, which could result in a weak signal strength. You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. Your local IT supplier will be able to advise on this. If you haven't already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software, it is essential to do so, to protect your investment. To really take advantage of wireless technology, you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. Or you could use one of the new Tablet computers, which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. And finally, you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print, scan, copy and fax.\",\n",

But the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.\"\\n\\nDespite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK\\'s P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. \"Carnival has an incredibly strong track record,\" Mr Champion.\\n\\nSimilarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, Royal Caribbean. \"While not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,\" wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. \"Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.\" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but for Carnival customers elsewhere it\\'s unlikely to make too much of a splash.\\n\\nAssuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in Carnival\\'s favour. In the wake of P&O Princess\\'s takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, \"slowing supply growth\" is a certainty, said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'The \\'ticking budget\\' facing the US\\n\\nThe budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial. The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, which tends to be critical of the President, looks at possible fault lines. US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. Under direct threat will be the federal government\\'s ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund. As soon as 2018, the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits.\\n\\nThe trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation\\'s total annual output.\\n\\nThis upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad. The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations. This does not bode well for US influence in the world. The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. The dollar is already sinking. Before too long, credit markets are likely to react, and interest rates will creep upwards. That will be the shock.\\n\\nInterest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing, automobiles, other consumer durables, agriculture, and small business. Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late 1970s. There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. The public outcry will force Congress to act. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. How did this happen?\\n\\nBy definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn\\'t adequately capture the current situation. Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. In addition, the United States has two significant military missions. The Bush administration\\'s chosen remedy is the least feasible one. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left. Law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean-up, economic development, the Small Business Administration, housing, veterans\\' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. It\\'s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. But serious savings can only be found where the big money is. Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private. Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation\\'s elderly and indigent.\\n\\nOn the revenue side, the lion\\'s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced.\\n\\nSome rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway. Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. First on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue, simplify the tax code, and restore some fairness eroded by the Bush tax cuts. Second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to Afghanistan, Iraq, or terrorism. Third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.',\n",

The average house price in England and Wales was £182,920, down from £187,971 in July-September. The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003. The government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004.

But foreign aid is due to rise by 10%, with more money to treat HIV/Aids and reward economic and political reform. Military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.\\n\\nCongress will spend several months debating George W Bush\\'s proposal.\\n\\nThe state department\\'s planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department\\'s request - including almost $6bn to assist US allies in the \"war on terror\". However, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle HIV/Aids, the BBC\\'s Jonathan Beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to $3bn, with much of that money going to African nations. Mr Bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his Millennium Challenge Corporation. The scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the US considers to be good governance and sound policies. Yet Mr Bush\\'s proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.\\n\\nA key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration\\'s proposed radical overhaul of Social Security, the pensions programme on which many Americans rely for their retirement income.\\n\\nSome experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. Neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the US emergency petroleum stockpile. Concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. The Bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases.\\n\\nThe outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at Agriculture and 5.6% at the Environmental Protection Agency. The spending plan for the year beginning 1 October is banking on a healthy US economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. Spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bush\\'s presidency. \"In order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,\" Mr Bush said in his budget message to Congress. Mr Bush has promised to halve the US\\'s massive budget deficit within five years. The deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in Mr Bush\\'s presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the US dollar lower. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. But its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would \"sunset\", or disappear, in 2010. Most Republicans, however, want them to stay in place. And the figures also rely on the \"Social Security trust fund\" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.',\n",

Chinese PC sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years, but are now growing more slowly. The company is still by far the biggest player in China, with more than a quarter of the market.

At the time, Ofcom offered BT the choice of change or splitting into two. Ofcom is carrying out a strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the UK telecom sector.

Internet service provider (ISP) Plus.net also backed the proposals saying \"we will be entirely happy if Ofcom accepts them\". \"BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field.

And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.\\n\\nMr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. \"We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts (EA), which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,\" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona. \"These may be too focused on one or two product lines.\" Activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (£1.57bn), compared to EA\\'s $17.8bn.

In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won\\'t be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this.

              " {'sequence': 'Booming markets shed few tears\\n\\nThe market, former British government minister Michael Heseltine once said, has no morality.\\n\\nAnd indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week\\'s disaster. Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. The MSCI World share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week. And this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts.\\n\\nIn fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.\\n\\nFor a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. The overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from India, only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance, and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. Indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.\\n\\nSecond, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. Most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring Jakarta Stock Exchange are in oil, technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. Tourist businesses, the most likely sufferers, are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. Those that are listed have suffered: Confifi Hotel Holdings, a small Sri Lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. But there are winners as well as losers. Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. In Indonesia, shares in state construction companies Adhi Karya and Semen Gresik have jumped sharply this week.\\n\\nMore broadly, the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact.\\n\\nAccording to the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at Colorado State University, there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. The need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely, the centre says, any sort of rebuilding boom, but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off. \"Although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale, our research indicates that most businesses, even those that are especially hard-hit, do indeed recover,\" the authors concluded.\\n\\nBut disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.\\n\\nIn particular, many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system, as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. In fact, again, the risks here are lower than they seem. Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. A series of recent shocks, the Colorado centre has argued, have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. The trillion-dollar debts of Japan\\'s banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo. And the US stock market was on its way down long before 11 September, 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks. \"It is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings,\" one Bombay trader said this week. \"But the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. Business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.\"',\n",

Concerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on the currency markets. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10. In India, where more than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.',\n",

Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\\n\\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA\\'s 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another\\'s share prices.\\n\\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.',\n",

The German exchange said it had held \"constructive, professional and friendly\" talks with the LSE. But Euronext declined to comment after the talks ended on Friday. Speculation is mounting that the Germans may raise their bid to £1.5bn. Deutsche Boerse previously offered £1.3bn, which was rejected by the LSE, while Euronext is rumoured to have facilities in place to fund a £1.4bn cash bid. So far, however, neither have tabled a formal bid. But a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nThere was speculation Euronext would use Friday\\'s meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over Deutsche Boerse\\'s own plans for dominance over the London market. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt has reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. \"The works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from London in the future,\" Reuters news agency reports a union source as saying. German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator\\'s promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid were successful.\\n\\nMeanwhile, LSE shareholders fear that Deutsche Boerse\\'s control over its Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions - would create a monopoly situation. This would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive. The German group\\'s ownership of Clearstream has been seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. Commentators believe Deutsche Boerse, which has now formally asked German authorities to approve its plan to buy the LSE, may offer to sell Clearstream to gain shareholder approval. Euronext, so far, has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the LSE - Europe\\'s biggest equity market - into a deal.',\n",

Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation. Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. This is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by New York's top law officer, Eliot Spitzer, and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the State of California. The SEC's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds, managed by MMC Capital, the company's private equity firm. Marsh's new chief executive, Michael Cherkasky, is trying to negotiate a settlement with Mr Spitzer. Mr Spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate America's misdeeds.\\n\\nThe uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks. According to the Financial Times, insurance analysts are now questioning whether Marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. Doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Could Yukos be a blessing in disguise?\\n\\nOther things being equal, the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.\\n\\nBut in the looking-glass world of modern Russia, the opposite might just be true, a new report* has argued. The study, from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, does not praise the rough handling of oil company Yukos. But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police. \"An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,\" the authors say.\\n\\nThe paper\\'s reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company. The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. In the West, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.\\n\\nAfter Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, he did not raise taxes, but put a lot of effort - too much, critics argue - into enforcement.\\n\\nSince then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year. After Mr Putin came to power, the company\\'s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and Sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. But shareholders benefited hugely: Sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.\\n\\nDoes this analysis make sense? In part, certainly. For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. Companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. Foreign direct investment, long negligible, is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in Europe. But the authors\\' model does not quite cover all the complexities. For a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue. In fact, the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in Russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. Companies can, for example, persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.\\n\\nAnd the authors\\' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western. Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. The case against Yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. As far as most commentators are concerned, the state is pursuing Yukos out of a political vendetta, rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. Since Yukos\\' founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the Russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Giving financial gifts to children\\n\\nYour child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future?\\n\\nGifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.\\n\\nThe government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund. The first vouchers, worth £250 or £500 for low-income families, will be distributed from January. All children born after 1st September 2002 will be eligible. Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 2005.\\n\\nParents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children\\'s deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.\\n\\nThere are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the Alliance & Leicester FirstSaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at £1.\\n\\nInterest earned by children is subject to income tax. However, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (£4,745 for the current tax year).\\n\\nIf the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. When the account is opened a form \"R85\", available from the bank or building society, should be completed. This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.\\n\\nThe tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children\\'s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents\\' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.\\n\\nAnother favourite solution is Premium Bonds. With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child\\'s guardian. The minimum for each purchase is £100 and Bonds are sold in multiples of £10.\\n\\nThere are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.\\n\\nOver the longer term, stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment, although in the shorter term they can be volatile. One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. These are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. These funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the FTSE 100. Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). The difference is that the charges are quite low. The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent. For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.',\n",

Air China\\'s primary listing will be in Hong Kong, with a secondary listing in London. The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars. However, investors may be wary of Chinese stocks.

US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It\\'s amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\\n\\nThe stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of Thursday.\\n\\nIn London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\\n\\nThe price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec\\'s attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\\n\\nFears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" said Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we\\'re headed to $30-35 but I don\\'t think we\\'re doing that yet.

The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\\n\\nWhen Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years\\' time.

Although interest rates still stand at a punitive 17.25%, inflation has fallen from 9% to 7% while exports are booming, particularly of agricultural products. \"For the first time in decades, we have all three economic policy pillars in line during a recovery,\" Finance Minister Antonio Palocci told the Associated Press news agency. \"Government accounts are in surplus, we have a current account surplus and inflation is under control.\"\\n\\nInvestors were deeply suspicious of President da Silva, a former trade union leader who campaigned on a programme of extensive land redistribution and a large rise in the minimum wage. However, Mr da Silva has stuck to an orthodox monetary policy inherited from his predecessor even in the face of last year\\'s economic crisis. This has earned him the disapproval of rural farm workers, thousands of whom who took to the streets of Brasilia on Thursday to protest against government policies. President da Silva has defended his policies, arguing that Brazil cannot afford to continue the cycle of boom and bust which afflicted it in recent decades.',\n",

G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit.\\n\\nOn Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output cut from oil producers\\' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end of the day. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy.\\n\\nThe latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across America\\'s public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy remained unaltered. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. Some had looked to the G20 meeting for direction. But Mr Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda.\\n\\nFor the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.\\n\\nUS exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap. In the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the total to $8.2 trillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world\\'s reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns. But already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in August found few takers. And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. \"It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said.',\n",

The economy is growing fast, they insist. Education levels among its young and large population are rising. Unemployment levels, in percentage terms, are heading fast towards single digits. Inflation is under control. A new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (£10.8bn) in three years.\\n\\nMoreover, government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. Income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. A loan restructuring deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pretty much in the can. And following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts, its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent.\\n\\nThe point of all this has been to convince Europe\\'s decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU, allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.\\n\\n\"The cake will be bigger for everybody,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener earlier this month. \"Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget.\" If admitted into the EU, Turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; £6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country\\'s State Planning Organisation. As Turkey\\'s gross domestic output (GDP) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. Turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in \"Old Europe\" once its population comes of age. By 2014, one in four Turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less. \"A literate and qualified Turkish population,\" insisted Mr Sener, \"will make a positive impact on the EU.\"\\n\\nThis runs contrary to the popular view that Turkey is getting ready to dig deep into EU taxpayers\\' wallets. However, Turkey\\'s assertions are confirmed by Brussels\\' own impact studies, which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy. But only over time. Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkey\\'s membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros. This would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid, though such payments should decline as the country\\'s farm sector, which currently employs one in three Turks, would employ just one in five by 2020.\\n\\nSuch high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkey\\'s government would never be delivered, say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunned.\\n\\nSome fear that rather than providing an educated, sophisticated labour force for Europe at large, the people who will leave Turkey to seek work abroad will be poor, uneducated - and plentiful. More recently, less palatable concerns - at least in liberal European circles - have been voiced, with senior EU or member state officials talking darkly of a \"river of Islam\", an \"oriental\" culture and a threat to Europe\\'s \"cultural richness\". Of course, many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country\\'s Muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government\\'s human rights record. Yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.\\n\\nCritics insist that much of the optimism about Turkey\\'s economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country\\'s current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.\\n\\nThe country\\'s massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU. \"In the new member states of the European Union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product,\" says Reza Moghadam, assistant director of the IMF\\'s European Department. \"At about 80% of GDP, Turkey\\'s gross debt is double that figure.\" Turkey\\'s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country\\'s devastating recession. \"There is no question that although Turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable,\" says Michael Deppler, director of the IMF\\'s European Department. \"Its debt is far too high for an emerging economy.\" A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria. But economics is not a science. And although the state of Turkey\\'s economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 December will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.',\n",

However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash.

In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE.

              " {'sequence': 'Iraqi voters turn to economic issues\\n\\nBeyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters.\\n\\nA vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. So there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. \"First rule of law, then the economy,\" says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003. Mr Hadi\\'s view about what the new government\\'s priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis. The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday\\'s election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq.\\n\\nJob creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the Iraqi people\\'s wish list. Nobody knows exactly how many Iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. \"Estimates of Iraq\\'s unemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40%,\" the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution says in its Iraq Index. But some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country\\'s oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003.\\n\\nIraq\\'s infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. But serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. One Iraqi woman told Ms Alexander about her frustration as she watched TV adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from Baghdad\\'s pharmacies. Observes Mr Hadi: \"The economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.\" An indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking principles. Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank Export & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq.\\n\\nForeign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. Bechtel\\'s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while Halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms Alexander. \"It is seen as a selling off of Iraq\\'s assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,\" she says. Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, she explains. In the West, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the majority of Iraq\\'s citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. Opinion polls suggest that \"people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things\", Ms Alexander says.\\n\\nYet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left the country three decades ago. \"I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,\" Mr Hadi says. \"Iraq\\'s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth.\"\\n\\nMany foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. But there are exceptions. Mr Hadi\\'s Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. Blackwatch\\'s Baghdad-based affiliate Falcon Group has dozens of people working for it across the country in Kirkuk and Baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the Iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Mr Hadi points out. \"These guys are trying to work. The Iraqi business people will do business at all times. \"Life goes on in Iraq, the people take responsibility, they want to live normal lives.\"',\n",

In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010. Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda. But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.\\n\\nOnly the UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy. The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development, while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU, the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010. Next week, the Commission will present revised proposals to meet the Lisbon goals. Many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.\",\n",

China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.\\n\\nStill, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.\\n\\nDespite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. \"There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,\" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings.\\n\\nChina\\'s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China\\'s currency. The government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \"We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,\" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. \"Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.\"',\n",

And the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life.\\n\\nMr Toshitsune is one of Japan\\'s 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. At his neat Osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, Mr Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: \"Well, what\\'s most important for me is to be Japan\\'s number one.\" Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. And when it comes to longevity, Japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. Women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and Europeans.\\n\\nOn the outskirts of Kyoto, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in their seventies.\\n\\n\"I think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved,\" he remarks. \"On average, we can live longer.\" Whether it\\'s the diet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined, or just something in the genes, Japan\\'s elderly are remarkable. But while life may be a game of golf for Mr Shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. Japan is the world\\'s least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US.\\n\\nBy 2007, Japan\\'s population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. This means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled.\\n\\n\"In the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population,\" explains Shigeo Morioka of the International Longevity Centre in Tokyo. So how will Japan\\'s finances stay on track? After a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country\\'s gross domestic product (GDP), the highest rate among industrialised countries. The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan\\'s welfare state will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan, asks; \"Who\\'s going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese worker? \"Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward?\" One option is further welfare reform. Another is immigration, possibly from the Philippines and Indonesia. But so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff.\\n\\nStanding next to Tokyo harbour is a version of New York\\'s Statue of Liberty. But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island.\\n\\n\"Japan has never really liked that option in its history and I think it\\'s an option that\\'s becoming more and more plausible and necessary,\" insists Mr Wood. In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. But for the Japanese economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash.\\n\\nOf course the Japanese could always have more children. The government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in Australia. But there would be no pay back until 2030, when today\\'s babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in Europe, starts to unfold in 2010. In contrast to Japan - and of course the European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. Although President Bush must re-devise Social Security to take account of a 130% rise in America\\'s over 65s, the IMF foresees a positive contribution to the US current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration.\\n\\nSome voices in Japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the Japanese labour market. They want a shift towards financial services, though doubts persist over the country\\'s ability, let alone willingness, to move away from manufacturing. \"Japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,\" says Mr Wood. Japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. Falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. There are fears that the world\\'s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. But none of this is Mr Toshitsune\\'s concern anymore. At 101, he chuckles that, he feels fine.',\n",

The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\\n\\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\\n\\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it\\'s showing job growth, it\\'s a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\\n\\nJob creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.',\n",

Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. His new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. Mr Glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the Red Devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last November.\\n\\nMan United had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. But newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. Last week, however, Mr Glazer issued a statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from a new bid.\\n\\nMeanwhile, United\\'s chief executive David Gill said in December that talks would not resume unless Glazer came up with \"definitive proposals\".

But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. United fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. They have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by Glazer since he first showed interest in the club in September 2003 and after Sunday\\'s announcement they vowed to fight on. \"We will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. We do not want him or anybody else taking over United,\" said Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters\\' Association. \"The campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since Glazer first showed interest in the club.\"',\n",

Many investors believe that Mr Bush\\'s policies are more business-friendly than those of his Democrat challenger, John Kerry. The higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll.\\n\\nInvestors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive, paving the way for a repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the 2000 election.\\n\\nThe Dow lost 5% of its value in the three weeks immediately after that election, when it was unclear who would occupy the White House. Mr Kerry conceded defeat on Wednesday, abandoning last-ditch hopes of carrying the vote in the swing state of Ohio. \"The relief for the markets may be that we have a decision and can move forward,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. Some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived, saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the US economy. \"I would look at the stock market rally for Bush as kind of a one-day event,\" said Ken Mayland at Clearview Economics. The US\\' recent economic performance has been mixed, with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures, and mounting worries over a record budget deficit. Elsewhere in the financial markets on Wednesday, the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen, while US oil prices closed up $1.26 at $50.88 a barrel in New York. The rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that President Bush is less likely than Mr Kerry to release supplies from the US\\' strategic oil reserve. Share prices in London, Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher.\\n\\nSuccessive polls in the run-up to Tuesday\\'s election had shown the two candidates running neck and neck.\\n\\nEconomic issues, as well as the war in Iraq, were the forefront of the campaign. In key swing states such as Ohio, which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years, President Bush\\'s handling of the economy became a crucial election issue. Senator Kerry attacked President Bush\\'s economic record during his campaign, hammering home the fact that a net 800,000 jobs were lost during his term in office. President Bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year, claiming that it has vindicated his tax-cutting agenda. As for future policies, both candidates pledged to bring America\\'s $422bn federal budget deficit under control. Senator Kerry planned to increase taxes on those earning more than $200,000 a year. President Bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for a second term.

Big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005; their views suggest the March reading could go as low as 15 - still in positive territory, but weaker. The dollar\\'s decline has strengthened the yen, making Japanese exports more expensive in the US.

Confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the March survey. Nonetheless, Japanese firms have been stepping up capital investment, and the survey found the pace is quickening.

Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\\n\\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\\n\\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\\n\\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world\\'s fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country\\'s exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people.

However, Judge Letitia Clark said the hearing would continue on Thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. Russian authorities are due to auction off Yuganskneftegas on 19 December to pay a huge tax bill sent to Yukos.\\n\\nRussian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm\\'s most lucrative asset Yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (£14bn) back tax bill, which they claim is owed by Yukos.\\n\\nFiling for bankruptcy protection in the US was \"a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders, employees and customers,\" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. The company added it had opted to take action through American courts as US bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company\\'s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders\\' investments. However, as the firm is based in Russia and has no significant US assets, lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case. \"We are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on Sunday,\" Zack Clement, a lawyer for Yukos, told Judge Clark in an emergency hearing in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday. As well as the bid to get Chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors, allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the Russian government. Yukos asked the Houston court to order Russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a \"campaign of illegal, discriminatory and disproportionate\" tax claims. Mr Clement said that under Russian law, the Russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law.\\n\\nHe added that the opening bid for the firm\\'s Yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that Yukos advisers say it is worth. \"We believe the only significant bidder at the auction on Sunday is Gazprom,\" he said, referring to Russia\\'s natural gas giant. Yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and \"will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm.\" Many commentators believe the Russian government\\'s aggressive pursuit of Yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

We will see.\"\\n\\nEarlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. \"In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used\", he said. An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. For that to happen Varig\\'s main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline\\'s employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country\\'s economic downturn.\\n\\nThe depreciation of Brazil\\'s currency has had a direct impact on the airline\\'s dollar debt as well as some of its costs. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. But the government can appeal the decision.',\n",

Laurent Beaudoin, part of the family that controls the Montreal-based firm, will take on the role of CEO under a newly created management structure.

The old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. The new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. The new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary, which is currently $94. The law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. However, when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.\\n\\nThe proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties, including Mr Lula's Worker Party. They considered that they undermined workers' rights. But President Lula became a defender of the reforms, arguing that the country's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. Nevertheless, Mr Adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the Central Bank needs to change its policy, focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.\",\n",

It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn\\'s shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\\n\\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field\\'s current value.\\n\\n\"Cairn refutes the government\\'s position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India\\'s state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\\n\\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn\\'s existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.',\n",

Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: £4.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.\\n\\n\"The company considers that the victor of today\\'s auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,\" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. He said the company would continue to make \"every lawful move\" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from \"this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property\". Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders\\' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.\\n\\nThe sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm\\'s bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. There were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the Kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite. But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.\\n\\nMystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: \"I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. So the main question was how to structure this transaction.\\n\\n\"I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. \"I would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner. This would give Gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. \"Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.\" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. And Paul Collison, chief analyst at Brunswick UBS, said: \"I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. \"Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government. There is still potential for surprises.\" Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.\\n\\nThe US bankruptcy court\\'s initial order on Thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to Yukos filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on Saturday. The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos\\' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the BBC\\'s Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable. Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. Menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports.',\n",

In 2002 S&N and United agreed to form a strategic partnership, one that would include a joint venture business and a UK investment in the Indian brewer. The joint venture was established in May 2003. with both parties having a 40% stake in the venture - Millennium Alcobev.

Kingfisher has market share of about 29%. In addition to the equity stake S&N is to invest 2.47bn rupees in United through non-convertible redeemable preference shares. Meanwhile, United\\'s budget airline, Kingfisher Airlines, is to buy 10 A320 aircraft from Airbus and has the option to buy 20 more aircraft in a deal worth up to $1.8bn. The airline, the brainchild of Mr Mallya, expects to start its operations by the end of April. The new airline would break even in the very first year of operation, Mr Mallya said.',\n",

The LSE, which saw its shares rise 25%, said the bid undervalued the business. Euronext - formed after the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. The LSE, Europe\\'s biggest stock market, is a key prize, listing stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion.\\n\\nEuronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe.

It is also working with Morgan Stanley. Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week, Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Frankfurt-based exchange, may well come back with an improved offer. It has long wanted to link up with London, and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. Responding to the LSE\\'s rebuff, Deutsche Boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than £3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits, and that it still hoped to make a cash bid.\\n\\nLast week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had \"been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented\". However, it has indicated it is open for further talks. Meanwhile, German magazine Der Spiegel said part of Mr Seifert\\'s negotiations with the LSE were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs. Many analysts believe German Boerse has more financial firepower than Euronext if it came to a bidding war.',\n",

Russia\\'s newspapers claimed that Baikal was a front for gas monopoly Gazprom, which had been expected to win. The sale has destroyed Yukos, once the owner of Yuganskneftegas, said founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. \"Yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s. The authorities have made themselves a wonderful Christmas present - Russia\\'s most efficient oil company has been destroyed,\" the Interfax news agency quoted Mr Khodorkovsky as saying via his lawyers.\\n\\nGazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a US court injunction barred it from taking part. Last week, Yukos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in a last-ditch attempt to hang on to Yuganskneftegas, which accounts for 60% of its output. A US judge banned Gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash. \"They screwed up the financing,\" said Ronald Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. \"And Gazprom doesn\\'t have this sort of money lying around.\"\\n\\nGazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase. \"It is a front for somebody but not necessarily for Gazprom,\" said Oleg Maximov, an analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow. \"We don\\'t know if this company is linked 100% to Gazprom.\\n\\n\"We tried to find it, but we couldn\\'t and as far as I know, the papers had the same result.\" The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said. One scenario is that Baikal will not pay when it is supposed to in two weeks time, putting Yuganskneftegas back in the hands of bailiffs and back within the reach of Gazprom. Yukos is not planning on letting go of its unit without a fight and has threatened legal action against any buyer. Menatep, Yukos main shareholders\\' group, has also threatened legal action. Yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges. It has been hit with more than $27bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for 20% of Russia\\'s oil output is inevitable.',\n",

CML figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in November as the number of people buying new homes fell. Elsewhere, the BBA added underlying mortgage lending rose by £4m in November, compared to October\\'s £4.29m. The CML said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since February 2003.\\n\\nData from the CML showed lending fell to just over £25bn in November, from £25.5bn a year earlier. Separate figures from the Building Societies Association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year, at a seasonally-adjusted £2.98bn. The figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website Rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a \"winter sale\" and slash prices by up to 8%. Miles Shipside, commercial director at Rightmove, said sellers would have to be \"more realistic with their asking prices\" to tempt buyers. The average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December, while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.\\n\\nRightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago. \"Even once the quieter holiday period is over, sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. In any business, excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices,\" Mr Shipside said.\\n\\n\"The proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling, even in the current market.\" Overall, asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their July peaks as the equivalent of £6,500 has been cut from an average property. A host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005. \"What is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole,\" CML director general Michael Coogan said. \"It\\'s a fairly consistent picture, showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again, which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market,\" Investec economist Philip Shaw said. \"However, the figures do suggest only a modest weakening, and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time, though a collapse is still unlikely.\"',\n",

Fannie Mae was criticised by financial regulators and could have to restate its earnings by up to $9bn (£4.6bn). It is America\\'s second largest financial institution.\\n\\nRecent investigations have exposed extensive accounting errors at Fannie Mae, which supplies funds to America\\'s $8 trillion mortgage market. Last week, the firm was admonished by the Securities and Exchange Commission which said it had made major errors in its financial reporting.\\n\\nThe financial regulator said Fannie Mae would have to raise substantial new capital to restore its balance sheet. Analysts said the SEC\\'s criticism made it impossible for Fannie Mae\\'s senior executives to remain. Mr Raines, head of the Office of Management and Budget under President Clinton, has taken early retirement while Mr Howard has also stepped down, the company said on Tuesday. KPMG, Fannie Mae\\'s independent auditor, will also be replaced. \"By my early retirement, I have held myself accountable,\" Mr Raines said in a statement.\\n\\nFannie Mae was found to have violated accounting rules relating to derivatives - financial instruments used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates - and some pre-paid loans. As a result, it could be forced to restate $9bn in earnings over the past four years, effectively wiping out a third of the company\\'s profits since 2001. Although not making loans directly to buyers, Fannie Mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market, underwriting half of all US house purchases. The firm operates under charter from the US Congress. It has faced stinging criticism from Congressional leaders who held hearings into its finances earlier this year and from government regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). \"We are encouraged that the board\\'s announcement signals a new culture and a new direction for Fannie Mae,\" Armando Falcon, OFHEO director said. The problems afflicting Fannie Mae are just the latest to hit the US mortgage industry. Freddie Mac, the country\\'s other largest mortgage firm, was forced to restate its earnings by $4.4bn last year and pay a $125m fine after an investigation of its books.',\n",

Meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor. The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. \"The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,\" RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said. \"The decision by the Bank of England not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate.\"\\n\\nThe figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the housing market. On Monday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December. Around the UK, the Midlands and South saw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than the national rate. In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more \"moderate\", RICS added. But the news failed to dent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at their most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised despite holding at lower levels. \"Sales usually pick up in the New Year and I am confident this year will be no exception,\" Mr Perry added.

              " {'sequence': 'Fresh hope after Argentine crisis\\n\\nThree years after Argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope.\\n\\nThe country\\'s economy is set to grow about 8% this year after seeing 9% growth last year, a sharp turnaround from 2002 when output fell 11%. The unemployment rate is improving, too: It is set to slip below 13% by the end of the year, down from 20% in May 2002. True, problems remain, but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) admits this. \"The Argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy,\" Thomas Dawson, an IMF director, said earlier this month.\\n\\nArgentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors. The debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the government\\'s decisions. Pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country\\'s massive debts. In response, angry crowds of ordinary Argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police. Two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month. Argentina was on the brink of collapse. The fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso\\'s decade-long peg to the US dollar in February 2002. The subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people\\'s life savings disappear. Scathes of companies went bust. \"Three years ago, every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis,\" said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine. It really was dire.\\n\\nBut since then, the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically, in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within Brazil. \"Agriculture and tourism are helping,\" said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine.\\n\\nMr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, was fortunate: At the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. But now he is using his money to help with the start-up a trading company. He explained that initially, his firm is going to export building materials to Spain and United States. Then, he would like to diversify to other areas, depending on the market. \"Locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now,\" he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re-opening.\\n\\nBut not all that shines is gold. Argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001. President Nestor Kirchner\\'s administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors, but with the debts\\' nominal value standing at around $100bn it is not proving easy. Debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate. Argentina\\'s current offer implies that the creditors would get just 25 cents for each dollar they are owed, according to the creditors. Understandably, they want more and until they do, both they and others are loath to continue lending. For President Kirchner, this proves a hopeless challenge. Real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay, observed Jack Boorman, adviser to IMF\\'s managing director, Rodrigo Rato. \"Everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the Argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached,\" he said. \"The cost is enormous, and continues to be paid, and will not be reversed by any restructuring.\"\\n\\nWith the international negotiations being troubled, it is of little help to President Kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well.\\n\\nThis is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits. \"The situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in Argentina, \" said Carlos Baez Silva, president of AARA, an association that represents bank account and bond holders. Few people have recovered more than about half their savings, Mr Baez Silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe. \"A lot of them invested in good faith,\" he said. \"The Argentine state responded by taking most of their investments.\" The affair has made Mr Baez Silva disillusioned with the country\\'s legal system. On occasion, the Supreme Court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents, he says, insisting that the system cannot be trusted. \"People have to deposit their money in the banks, not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses.\" Mr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, agreed. \"If I have to save pesos [the local currency] there is not much problem, but I will think twice before I deposit dollars in a bank\".',\n",

Rosneft bought 100% of Baikal Finance Group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of Russia\\'s booming oil industry. Rosneft will now control about 16% of Russia\\'s total crude oil output. Yukos share jumped in Moscow, climbing as much as 50% before being suspended.\\n\\nRosneft is already in the process of merging with Gazprom, the world\\'s biggest gas company, a move that will see Gazprom return to majority state-ownership.\\n\\nBaikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant Yukos\\'s main production division at a forced auction on Sunday. \"Everything was done by market methods,\" Mr Putin said at his year-end press conference in Moscow. Shedding some light on the Kremlin\\'s motivation, Mr Putin referred to a period of so-called \"cowboy capitalism\" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.\\n\\nHe said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery, including law breaking, by people seeking to acquire valuable state property. \"Now the state, using market methods, is safeguarding its interests. I think this is quite normal,\" the Russian president said. A Rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a \"balanced, national energy corporation.\"\\n\\nThe latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos, one of Russia\\'s biggest companies to the brink of collapse. The Russian government put Yukos\\'s Yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $27bn (£14bn) bill for back taxes and fines.\\n\\nAnalysts say that Yukos\\'s legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the US are probably what caused this week\\'s cloak-and-dagger dealings. Gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a US court injunction. By selling the Yukos unit to little-known Baikal and then to Rosneft, Russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said. \"You cannot sue the Russian government,\" said Eric Kraus, a strategist at Moscow\\'s Sovlink Securities. \"The Russian government has sovereign immunity.\" \"The government is renationalising Yuganskneftegas.\"\\n\\nEven so, analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go. The Rosneft announcement came just hours after Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday\\'s auction. It has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn. The claim was made at the latest hearing in the US bankruptcy court in Houston, Texas, where Yukos, had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. If found in contempt of the US court order blocking the auction, Gazprom could face having foreign assets seized. Yukos\\' lawyers had also been expected to try to have Baikal\\'s assets frozen. Lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because Yukos - with an office in Houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of US law which has worldwide jurisdiction. Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.',\n",

Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation. Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover.

The SEC's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds, managed by MMC Capital, the company's private equity firm.

But the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about £55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be assessed in the New Year. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case.\\n\\nThe tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill\\'s private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.\\n\\nA spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as \"very disappointing\", but pointed to some criticism of Merrill\\'s procedures within the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba\\'s claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of \"laddish culture\" at the bank. \"We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,\" Merrill said in a statement. \"Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. \"Merrill Lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.\"\\n\\nBased in London\\'s financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrill\\'s global private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of Merrill\\'s most important customers. But in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba\\'s claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba\\'s division had been losing about $1m a week. Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.',\n",

The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits.

The figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in October. The official US policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.\\n\\nThe US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from \"abnormal and dangerous heights\" set in 2002.

Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin US deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend remains downwards.

Munich Re, the world\\'s largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros (£70m; $136m).\\n\\nAt least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India and Thailand among the worst hit.

A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe\\'s fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros.

Zurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster.\\n\\nThe impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said.\\n\\nMost US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds.

It\\'s more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure,\" said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG Edwards & Co.\\n\\nMany of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a US-based insurance expert. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch.\\n\\nMitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. But the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is incalculable. \"We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped out. Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,\" said Jan Egeland, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The Association of British insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. It said loss of possessions will usually be covered, but the Association stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies.',\n",

Its mid-year economic review forecasts growth of 6-6.5% in 2004, compared with 8.2% in 2003. Higher oil prices, the level of tax collections, and an unfavourable monsoon season affecting the farm sector had hurt the economy in April-September, it said.',\n",

US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\\n\\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair\\'s computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\\n\\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways\\' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\\n\\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\\n\\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry\\'s compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway\\'s ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline\\'s crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.',\n",

Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch. Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. World Bank spokesman Damien Milverton told the Wall Street Journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief.\\n\\nTourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). In the Maldives islands, in the Indian ocean, two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism.\\n\\nBut the damage covers fishing, farming and businesses too, with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves. International agencies have pledged their support; most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.\\n\\n\"The IMF stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need,\" said managing director Rodrigo Rato. Only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh currently receive IMF support, while Indonesia, the quake\\'s epicentre, has recently graduated from IMF assistance. It is up to governments to decide if they want IMF help. Other agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank, have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed. There is no underestimating the size of the problem, however. The United Nations\\' emergency relief coordinator, Jan Egeland, said that \"this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas... so many vulnerable communities. \"Many people will have [had] their livelihoods, their whole future destroyed in a few seconds.\" He warned that \"the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself\" because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water.\\n\\nInsurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage, but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the $27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the US earlier this year.\\n\\n\"The region that\\'s affected is very big so we have to check country-by-country what the situation is\", said Serge Troeber, deputy head of the natural disasters department at Swiss Re, the world\\'s second biggest reinsurance firm. \"I should assume, however, that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the US,\" he said. Munich Re, the world\\'s biggest reinsurer, said: \"This is primarily a human tragedy. It is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be.\" Allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability. However, a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region, rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there.\\n\\nThe International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told the Reuters news agency that it was seeking $6.5m for emergency aid.\\n\\n\"The biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases, particularly malaria and diarrhoea,\" the aid agency was quoted as saying. The European Union has said it will deliver 3m euros (£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid, according to the Wall Street Journal. The EU\\'s Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, Louis Michel, was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid \"in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster\". Other countries also are reported to have pledged cash, while the US State Department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region. Getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend\\'s events.\\n\\nMany of the worst-hit areas, such as Sri Lanka, Thailand\\'s Phuket island and the Maldives, are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies.\\n\\nDecember and January are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern Asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump. Growth has been rapid in southeast Asia, with the World Tourism Organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004. In southern Asia that expansion is 23%. \"India continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development, but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country,\" the WTO said. \"Arrivals to other destinations such as... Maldives and Sri Lanka also thrived.\" In Thailand, tourism accounts for about 6% of the country\\'s annual gross domestic product, or about $8bn. In Singapore the figure is close to 5%. Tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency. In the short-term, however, travel companies are cancelling flights and trips.

India\\'s Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka\\'s stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\\n\\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\\n\\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry\\'s fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won\\'t be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage. However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.',\n",

The organisation has found itself in trouble after being accused of helping to topple Georgia\\'s former president. It denies having any role, but offices have had to close across the region.\\n\\nThe OSI shut its office in Moscow last year and has withdrawn from Uzbekistan and Belarus. In the Ukraine earlier this year, Mr Soros - who took on the Bank of England in the 1990s - and won, was pelted by protestors. \"This legal prosecution can be considered an attempt by the government to force Soros Foundation-Kazakhstan to cease its activities in Kazakhstan and shut its doors for Kazakh citizens and organisations,\" the OSI said.\\n\\nThe OSI aims to promote democratic and open, market-based societies. Since the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan has been dominated by its president Nursultan Abish-uly Nazarbayev. He has powers for life, while insulting the president and officials has been made a criminal offence. The government controls the printing presses and most radio and TV transmission facilities. It operates the country\\'s national radio and TV networks. Recent elections were criticised as flawed and the opposition claimed there was widespread vote rigging. Supporters, however, say he brings much needed stability to a region where Islamic militancy is on the rise. They also credit him with promoting inter-ethnic accord and pushing through harsh reforms.',\n",

Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. It had wanted to help fund Gazprom\\'s plans for a $10bn (£5.18bn) bid for Yukos unit Yuganskneftegas.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank would have earned large fees from the deal, which could not be carried out because US chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the Kremlin\\'s auction of Yuganskneftegas on 19 December illegal under US law.\\n\\nBut the US bankruptcy court judge in Texas granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part. Yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with Gazprom. The winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm, Baikal Finance Group, which was snapped up days later by Rosneft, a Russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with Gazprom. The effect of these transactions is to renationalise Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government, which was in a tax dispute with Yukos.\\n\\n\"This blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case,\" Deutsche Bank said in its court filing. Mike Lake, a spokesman for Yukos\\' lawyers, said on Tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection, and \"we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again,\" he said. Yukos has said it intends to seek $20bn in damages from the buyer of Yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through. In its filing, Deutsche Bank said Houston was \"a jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations.\"\\n\\nIt also said the US bankruptcy court should not become involved in \"a tax dispute between the Federation and one of its corporate citizens\". It suggested the European Court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between Russia and Yukos. The next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on 6 January. Analysts believe the tax dispute between the Russian government and Yukos is partly driven by Russian president Vladimir Putin\\'s hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khordokovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail, and on trial for fraud and tax evasion.',\n",

The agreement in question dates back to GM\\'s decision to buy 20% of Fiat\\'s auto division in 2000. At the time, it gave the Italian firm the right, via a \\'put option\\', to sell the remaining stake to GM. In recent weeks, Fiat has reiterated its claims that this \\'put\\' is still valid and legally binding. However, GM argues that a Fiat share sale made last year, which cut GM\\'s holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by Fiat have terminated the agreement.\\n\\nSelling the Fiat\\'s car-making unit may not prove so simple, analysts say, especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to Italy\\'s industrial heritage. Political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise. \"We are not expecting Fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling GM at this point,\" brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a note to investors, adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. \"As far as we are aware, the Agnelli family, which indirectly controls at least 30% of Fiat, has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business. \"Fiat may be willing to cancel the \\'put\\' in exchange for money.\"',\n",

The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the latest proposal. \"This move today is the best of both worlds,\" it said. \"Employers have the ability to define the end point of the employer-employee relationship and employees have flexibility with a right to request to work past the age of 65.\" But Age Concern said imposing a retirement age of 65 was \"cowardly\" and a \"complete u-turn\". \"This makes a mockery of the Government\\'s so-called commitment to outlawing ageism, leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel,\" said Gordon Lishman, director general of Age Concern England . \"It is now inevitable that older people will mount legal challenges to the decision using European law.\" The decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension, the government has said.',\n",

The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares. \"The markets are starting to fear a more aggressive Fed in 2005,\" said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research. The Dow Jones index dropped almost 100 points on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades. The dollar also gained ground against sterling on Tuesday, reaching $1.8832 to the pound before slipping slightly on Wednesday morning.\\n\\nThe release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 December meeting was much faster than usual, indicating the Fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking. This, too, is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come. The key Fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That long trough \"might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets\", said the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates. The odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early February, economists said. But the respite for the dollar, which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive US trade and budget deficits, may be short-lived. \"You can\\'t rule out a further correction... but we don\\'t think it\\'s a change in direction in the dollar,\" said Jason Daw at Merrill Lynch. \"Nothing fundamental has changed.\"',\n",

Allowing for changes in calculating statistics, the average number of people out of work was the highest since 1990 - or a rate of 10.8%. Bad weather and a sluggish economy were blamed for the rise. The increase \"was due primarily to the onstart of winter\", labour office chief Frank-Juergen Weise said.\\n\\nUnadjusted, the figures showed unemployment rose 206,900 to 4.64 million - with many sectors such as construction laying off workers amid bad weather. \"The three years of stagnation in the German economy came to an end in 2004. But the upturn is still not strong enough\" to boost the labour market, Mr Weise added. News of the rise came as government welfare reforms came into force, a move that is expected to see unemployment swell still further in coming months. Under the Hartz IV changes, the previous two tier system of benefits and support for the long term unemployed has been replaced with one flat-rate payout. In turn, that means more people will be classified as looking for work, driving official figures higher.\\n\\n\"Be prepared for a nasty figure for January 2005, about five million unemployed on a non-seasonally adjusted basis,\" warned HVB Group economist Andreas Rees.

Delta\\'s new SimpliFares were trialled from August last year on tickets from Cincinnati, its second-largest hub.\\n\\nThe airline says no one-way economy fare will now be priced higher than $499 (£264), and no first-class fare will be priced higher than $599. It is also eliminating a Saturday-night stay requirement on discount fares and will give further reductions to customers opting for non-refundable tickets, booking in advance and online. Delta, which lost $646m in the three months to September, was forced to cut 6,900 jobs worldwide as part of its aim to slash $5bn from its costs. In October, it reached a crucial agreement with pilots on pay and conditions and it has also issued new shares to staff in return for wage cuts.

Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos\\' former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.\\n\\nIt was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.\\n\\nState-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC\\'s plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin\\'s recent visit to New Delhi. \"It would make great sense for us to build on that,\" said Mr Aiyar. India\\'s oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, India\\'s economy is booming and the country\\'s thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\\n\\nIndia produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\\n\\n\"For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. \"We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,\" Mr Westwood said. \"By 2020, production may only be at half of today\\'s levels.\" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia\\'s Siberian coast.\\n\\nONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\\n\\nChinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC\\'s interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world\\'s biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin\\'s clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos\\' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.',\n",

Capital Economics, which has in the past predicted a sharp fall in UK house prices, branded Halifax\\'s findings a \"temporary surprise,\" which would be reversed over the coming months. \"The month by month volatility of the Halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is a clear downward trend in house prices,\" a Capital Economics statement said.\\n\\nExperts believe five interest rate rises since November 2003 are cutting borrowers\\' appetite for debt.\\n\\nDespite recording a price rise in December, the Halifax survey concluded that there was \"continuing signs of a genuine slowdown in the housing market.\" Martin Ellis, Halifax chief economist, said that there was no need to revise the bank\\'s prediction, made last month, that prices would fall by 2% in 2005. \"Sound housing market fundamentals will continue to underpin the market in 2005, ensuring that the market remains healthy and that house prices fall only slightly,\" Mr Ellis said. If the bank\\'s prediction of a 2% price drop comes true, it will be the first annual fall in nine years.\\n\\nThe bank said that the recent pattern of house prices rising the fastest in the north of England continued in December. In the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber, Halifax said prices rose by 3% and 1.2% in the two regions respectively during the month. At the other send of the scale, prices in the South East and London fell by 1.6% and 0.5% respectively. The biggest decline was seen in Wales where prices fell by 6.2%, an area that had experienced strong house price growth during most of 2004. Overall, Halifax said prices in the final quarter of 2004 were 0.1% higher than in the previous quarter. This was the smallest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 2000, the bank said. As a result, annual house price inflation dipped below 20% during the final few months of 2004.',\n",

Trendy youth labels also sold well, with sales jumping 28% at young women\\'s clothing retailer Bebe Stores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices. The company saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier.\\n\\nCustomers at the world\\'s biggest retailer are generally seen to be the most vulnerable to America\\'s economic woes.\\n\\nCommentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart faced a \"stand-off\" with shoppers, stepping up its discounts as the festive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best bargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across the sector, Christmas sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual retail sales - would have been far worse. \"So far, we are faring better than expected, but the results are still split,\" Ken Perkins, an analyst at research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. \"Stores that have been struggling over the last couple of months appear to be continuing that trend. And for stores that have been doing well over the last several months, December was a good month.\" Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier.\\n\\nOne discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, which continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-expected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and varied. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw its same store sales sink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as it battled fierce competition. Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas period. Accessory vendor Claire\\'s Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt little Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year. \"This was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw a dearth of exciting, new items,\" Kurt Barnard, president of industry forecaster Retail Consulting Group, said. However, one beneficiary of the desertion of the High Street is expected to be online stores. According to a survey by Goldman Sachs & Co, Harris Interactive and Neilsen/Net Ratings sales surged 25% over the holiday season to $23.2bn.',\n",

Its shares fell nearly 3% in London as the bank raised funds for the deal by selling new stocks worth £1bn ($1.8bn), equal to 10% of its share capital. Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB.\\n\\nThe South Korean bank will also make up 22% of the group\\'s total assets. The move, a year after Citigroup beat Standard Chartered to buy Koram bank, would be the South Korean financial sector\\'s biggest foreign takeover. This time around, Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal. KFB is South Korea\\'s seventh largest bank, with 3 million retail customers, 6% of the country\\'s banking market and an extensive branch network.\\n\\nThe country\\'s banking market is three times the size of Hong Kong\\'s with annual revenues of $44bn. Standard Chartered has its headquarters in London but does two thirds of its business in Asia, and much of the rest in Africa. \"We\\'re comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won,\" said Standard Chartered chief executive Mervyn Davies at a London press conference. Standard Chartered said KFB was a \"well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce\" and represented a \"significant acquisition in a growth market\". In London, Standard Chartered\\'s sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down, and contributing to the FTSE 100\\'s 0.3% decline. Standard Chartered\\'s shares were 28 pence lower at 925p by midday. Some analysts also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB. The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by April 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006, Standard Chartered said.\\n\\nRival banking giant HSBC, which is based in London and Hong Kong, was also in the running. Standard Chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the Christmas break. \"They were able to move so quickly it caught HSBC by surprise,\" the Financial Times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying. HSBC will now have to wait for the next South Korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be Korea Exchange Bank, also currently in the hands of a US group. Standard Chartered said it was buying 100% of KFB, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank\\'s complex dual ownership. The South Korean government owns 51.4% of KFB, while the remaining shareholding, and operational control, are in the hands of US private equity group Newbridge Capital. Newbridge bought its stake during the government\\'s nationalisation of several banks in the wake of the 1997 Asia-wide currency crisis which crippled South Korea\\'s financial institutions.\\n\\nSouth Korea\\'s economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year. Although often thought of an export-driven economy, South Korea\\'s service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so. Services now make up roughly 40% of the economy, and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit. Bad loan problems followed; LG Card, the country\\'s biggest credit card provider, has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months, for instance. But analysts believe South Korea\\'s financial services industry is still in its infancy, offering plenty of scope for new products. Standard Chartered sees \"the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products\". Since 1999, KFB has been restructured from a wholesale bank into a retail bank focused on mortgage lending, which makes up 45% of its loans.',\n",

It came not long after the Expediency Council - Iran\\'s ultimate decision-maker - blessed Mr Khatami\\'s policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking.

But, the EC did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. Under EU rules, member countries must keep their deficits below 3%.

Recent evidence has suggested that the UK housing market is slowing after interest rate increases, and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. But while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market, annual house price inflation is still strong, up 13.8% in the year to November. Economists, however, forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. \"Overall, the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data,\" said Mark Miller, at HBOS Treasury Services. \"The ODPM data is a fairly lagging indicator.\"\\n\\nThe figures come after the Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade.

It is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.\\n\\nThe ODPM data showed the average house price was £192,713 in England; £139,544 in Wales; £116,542 in Scotland, and £111,314 in Northern Ireland.\\n\\nAll areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the ODPM said. The North East showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber on 21.7%, and the North West on 21.1%. The East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%. In London, the area with the highest average house price at £262,825, annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.',\n",

That took 2004\\'s total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year\\'s main concerns for the US economy.

Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.',\n",

Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over a possible offer. A £1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of £1.4bn, while its German rival may up its bid to the £1.5bn mark. Neither has yet tabled a formal bid, but the LSE is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE\\'s managed bid process.\\n\\nDespite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the LSE\\'s board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming \"increasingly frustrated\" with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse\\'s £1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE\\'s decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period. Meanwhile, the German exchange\\'s offer has come under fire recently. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. Others claim it will weaken the city\\'s status as Europe\\'s financial centre, while German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator\\'s promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid is successful. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse\\'s control over its Clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions. LSE shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation, weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive.',\n",

The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said.

Many large Russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.\\n\\nMr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin\\'s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. The assault on Yukos\\' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. \"The task is not simply to double GDP; instead it is to use GDP to qualitatively improve people\\'s lives,\" Mr Gref told Kommersant. \"We don\\'t need simply to increase GDP, but to improve its structure.\" Instead of focusing on headline growth figures, Russia needed to focus on better institutions, such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.',\n",

State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; £165bn).\\n\\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in Washington. The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said the report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. The US's overall trade deficit with China was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.\",\n",

The KSE index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 points in the first two trading days of the week. Energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% rise since Monday morning.\\n\\nIn 2002, the KSE was the world\\'s best performing stock market, with the index rising 112%.\\n\\nPakistani investors are expecting the KSE to repeat, if not improve on, its 2002 performance. Jubilant investors danced on the streets as the market closed for the day on Tuesday, confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 January. Others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating, continued to warn that the \"bubble may burst any time\". \"That\\'s rubbish,\" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News website. \"Whenever the market reflects Pakistan\\'s true economic reality, it is described as a bubble.\" Mr Lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations.\\n\\nMarket analysts are inclined to agree with Mr Lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factors behind the KSE\\'s performance. Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan\\'s credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market. Standard & Poor\\'s upgraded Pakistan a few weeks ago. There are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of February.\\n\\nThen, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. \"Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the market\\'s performance,\" says Mr Lakhani. One leading Karachi broker said the real reasons may be political. \"If you file a $1.3 trillion case against Saudi money after 9/11, Arab money will not go to the US any more.\" A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE.\\n\\nLocally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market\\'s advantage.\\n\\nAn anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA, a countrywide alliance of religious parties, has fizzled out. The release of Asif Zardari, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto\\'s husband, has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition Pakistan People\\'s Party. Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. This, they say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of their disagreements. The market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the US, a country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the South Asian neighbours. \"You can call it a peace dividend,\" smiles one broker. \"Let us see how long one can reap its benefits.\"',\n",

That pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. Imports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%. A weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months. \"Things are getting worse, but that\\'s to be expected,\" said David Wyss of Standard & Poor\\'s in New York. \"The first thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of imports. \"We are seeing improved export orders.

Another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China, which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China during October, exporting a little under $3bn. \"It seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains,\" said Anthony Crescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. The trade deficit and the shortfall with China \"are big issues going forward\". The Commerce Department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year.

Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. Several jurisdictions, notably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. Equally, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel.\\n\\nAt the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their \"green\" credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of its Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in the year.\\n\\nHonda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a hybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Even sports car maker Porsche may join the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its Cayenne SUV.\\n\\nOthers remain more sceptical. Nissan has bought Toyota\\'s hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. \"We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,\" Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said. \"We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.\" Volkswagen, meanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. And some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction. \"The average consumers aren\\'t willing to pay that premium for a car they won\\'t drive more than six years,\" said Anthony Pratt from JD Power.',\n",

Mitsubishi has been hit by a recall scandal and the withdrawal of support from shareholder DaimlerChrysler. The US-German firm, once a majority shareholder, decided last April to stop providing financial backing. Mitsubishi's sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. Mitsubishi is due to unveil a recovery plan later in January.

But the blow to many low-income people could be \"enormous\". The Paris Club of rich creditor nations on Wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries.\\n\\nThe move was aimed at helping South Asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas, though so far only Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Seychelles have indicated that they will take it up.\\n\\nOther countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks. \"Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster,\" said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali. Donor nations have promised to give $717m (£379m) in disaster relief over the next six months, according to the United Nations.\\n\\nMr Ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered, saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on \"concerns over sanitation and health conditions, and other basic needs\" being \"properly and quickly addressed\".\\n\\nThere are 1.9 billion people in Asia living on less than $2 a day. The ADB fears that 1 million Indonesians could join them, while in India just over half a million people - 645,000 - are at risk of falling into poverty. A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives are also facing poverty. In the Maldives, where 43% of the population already lives on less than $2 a day, this could rise to half. Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the two countries the ADB fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami. Sri Lanka\\'s government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn. A government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the ADB, World Bank and Japanese aid agencies on Wednesday, and promised to publish the plan within 10 days.\\n\\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. Although Indonesia\\'s northern province of Aceh suffered the worst death toll, the region\\'s oil and natural gas production facilities \"have survived intact\", the report said. However, it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor people\\'s livelihoods in Aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater. \"This is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering. But the economies of the affected countries except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage,\" the ADB report said. Some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts, thereby creating jobs. At a meeting in Thailand, ABD president Thadao Chino said he was confident of the country\\'s \"own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements\". Thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze, while India has also rejected international aid, saying it can cope on its own resources. Debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades, making it more expensive to borrow money in future. Indonesia, however, is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring. It is one of the world\\'s most indebted countries.',\n",

A bid at that price would value the company at A$3.1bn ($2.4bn; £1.25bn ). Fosters said it was currently in discussions \"which may lead to a major corporate announcement\".\\n\\nIn a separate statement, Southcorp confirmed the brewer had asked for talks. Both firms asked the Sydney stock market to suspend trading in their shares until Monday.

It seized the top spot when it bought Australian firm BRL Hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. Since then, it has paid $1bn for US wine maker Robert Mondavi, bought last month. Fosters\\' main wine business is Beringer Blass Wine Estate. Its best known brand is Fosters lager, though it makes a clutch of beer brands, and spirits. Analysts were divided on Thursday about whether Fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of Southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival. \"Currently, I think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover,\" said one analyst quoted by the Agence France Presse news agency.

Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\\n\\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers\\' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain\\'s retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\\n\\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\\n\\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists\\' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers\\' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers\\' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\\n\\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year\\'s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.',\n",

Part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. But the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.\\n\\nThe trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on Wall Street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets.\\n\\nBy 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. Against the pound, the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1,8923. \"The dollar\\'s fall has been sudden, violent and appropriate given this number,\" said Brian Taylor of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. \"Recent exchange rate movements certainly haven\\'t had any impact yet.\" Treasury Secretary John Snow put a brave face on the news, saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion. \"The economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners.\"\\n\\nAlthough the White House officially still backs the US\\'s traditional \"strong dollar\" policy, it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. The dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. The main catalyst, most economists accept, is the large budget deficit on the one hand, and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the US - on the other. The trade deficit is a large part of the latter. In November, the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals, as well as of cars, consumer goods and food. One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. Although China\\'s overall trade surplus is expanding, according to Chinese government figures, the Commerce Department revealed the US\\'s deficit with China was $19.6bn in November, down from $19.7bn the month before. But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years.',\n",

The quotas for developing nations, ended on 1 January, gave them a set share of the rich countries\\' markets. They also limited the amount countries like China could export to the big markets of the United States and EU.\\n\\n\"We understand that some (owners)... were complaining that the South African rand was strong against the US dollar, and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the United States,\" Mr Macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital, Maseru.

Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the \"unfiltered truth\".\\n\\n\"There are lots of \\'urban legends\\' going around these days about Wal-Mart, but facts are facts. Wal-Mart is good for consumers, good for communities and good for the US economy,\" Mr Scott said in a separate statement.\\n\\nIts adverts - and a new website - outlined the group\\'s plans to create more than 10,000 US jobs in 2005. Wal-Mart\\'s average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (£3.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say. Unions accuse Wal-Mart of paying staff less than its rivals do, with fewer benefits. In California, the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. Lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs. \"I think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people,\" said Larry Bevington, chairman of Save Our Community - a group fighting to prevent Wal-Mart opening a store in Rosemead, California. Wal-Mart is also fighting two lawsuits - one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees.\\n\\nMeanwhile Eli Lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers, to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug Prozac.\\n\\nThe move is in response to a British Medical Journal article that claimed \"missing\" Lilly documents linked Prozac to suicide and violent behaviour. In the averts, entitled An Open Letter from chief executive Sidney Taurel, the company says the article continues to \"needlessly spread fear among patients who take Prozac\". \"It was simply wrong to suggest that information on Prozac was missing, or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators,\" the letter added. Eli Lilly\\'s chief medical officer Alan Breier said that the article was \"false and misleading\" as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and presented to an FDA meeting in 1991. Later, FDA medical advisors agreed the claims were based on faulty data and there was no increased risk of suicide.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'US retail sales surge in December\\n\\nUS retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in December, boosted by strong car sales.\\n\\nSeasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month, compared to 0.1% a month earlier, boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after Christmas. Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added. The gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.\\n\\nThe increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). Sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion However, if automotives are excluded from December\\'s data, retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. Home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well, rising 2.2%. But as well as hitting the shops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. However, analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the Federal Reserve Bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises. \"Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely, sustaining the US expansion. Given that attitude, the Fed remains likely to continue boosting the Fed funds rate at upcoming meetings,\" UBS economist Maury Harris told Reuters.\\n\\nRetail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US. Consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the World Trade Centre attacks. During that time, sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. Looking ahead, analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the High Street with consumer spending remaining strong. The belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. The number of Americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367,000, the highest rate since September. However, long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.',\n",

Analysts added that if the carmaking sector - which saw production fall 0.5% - had been excluded the data would have been more impressive. The latest increase means industrial output has grown 4.2% in the past year. Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US economy, with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of a recovery in retail sales. \"This is very consistent with an economy growing at 3.5 to 4.0%. It is congruent with job growth and consumer optimism,\" Comerica chief economist David Littman said of the figures.\\n\\nThe US economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three months between July and September, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 during the same period. While the employment figures are not spectacular, experts believe they are enough to whittle away at America\\'s 5.4% jobless rate. A breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase, surging 2.1%, while factory output rose 0.3%. But utility output dropped 1.4%.

Opposition from TCI has fuelled speculation that the proposed takeover could fail. Rival exchange operator Euronext has also said it may bid for the LSE.

The Deutsche Boerse was prepared to pay for the LSE \"exceeds the potential benefits of this acquisition\", said TCI.\\n\\nAnother Deutsche Boerse shareholder on Monday also appeared to back TCI\\'s call.

Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown\\'s forecast of 3% to 3.5%. It also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.\\n\\nIn its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a \"golden period\" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.\\n\\nBut it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major \"imbalances\" in the economy. Deloitte\\'s chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: \"The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. \"Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.\"\\n\\nEconomic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes. Gordon Brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%. However, Deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. It expects a series of \"aggressive\" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. \"Although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the UK economy,\" Mr Bootle.',\n",

The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. \"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,\" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.\\n\\nSports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission\\'s road rage. It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. Mr Wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure. Mr Wang\\'s team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; £26). The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries\\' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. Unclogging Beijing\\'s increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the Chinese authorities, who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games.',\n",

Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. \"The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,\" the report said. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. Inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. Although major exports have not suffered, the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as \"Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level\" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka\\'s request for a freeze on loan repayments.',\n",

Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency\\'s website.\\n\\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government\\'s battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or \\'river of golden sand\\' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency\\'s list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\\n\\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China\\'s energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.',\n",

Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action?\\n\\nDr Taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as \"too little, too late\". The issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the World Economic Forum, which meets in Davos, Switzerland, next week. The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. Most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff. The UN programme tackling Aids, UNAIDS, pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with HIV/Aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible.\\n\\nOne company that does have a plan is Anglo-American, the international mining company, which estimates an HIV prevalence of 24% among its 130,000-strong Southern African workforce.\\n\\nOver the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for HIV infection, coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to Aids. Over 90% of the 2,200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work. \"Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations,\" said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American.\\n\\n\"Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol,\" he said. \"Providing access to treatment is a critical part of this.\" Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report. The gap is even wider in China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Russia, the so-called \"next wave\" countries, which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new HIV/Aids cases worldwide by 2010. The report adds \"an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV/Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting,\" said David Bloom, professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health.\\n\\nThe WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them.

A new attraction - Walt Disney Studios - has recently opened its site near Paris. The company's currently traded stock tumbled in Paris on the latest news, shedding 15% to 22 euro cents. EuroDisney will sell the new shares priced at 9 euros cents each. The US Disney Corporation and Saudi Arabian prince Al-Walid bin Talal, the firm's two main shareholders, will buy the new stock. The restructuring deal is the second in the firm's troubled financial history; its finances were first reorganised in 1994.\",\n",

As for how they spend their cash, the bulk goes on personal care, soft drinks and food, Datamonitor said.\\n\\nDatamonitor adds that British teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs - the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality.\\n\\nBritish teenage girls, compared to their counterparts in seven European countries, are the most keen to use make-up products. Nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up. According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as \"particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines\". And the good times are likely to keep rolling for British children, as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008.',\n",

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.\\n\\nThe Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEF\\'s ritzier event in Davos.\\n\\nThe organisers of the Brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit. However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well. \"Global warming\" features particularly high. WEF participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. Davos itself is in deep frost. The snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20C and less.\\n\\nUltimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world\\'s 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.\\n\\nBut much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this year\\'s forum seems to lack an overarching theme. \"Taking responsibility for tough choices\" is this year\\'s official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. One thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with Iran, Iraq and China are set to dominate discussions. Pointedly, only one senior official from President Bush\\'s new administration is scheduled to attend. The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.\\n\\nUkraine\\'s new president, Viktor Yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.\\n\\nThe European Union\\'s top leaders, among them German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European Commission President Manuel Barosso, will be here too. Mr Blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by French President Jacques Chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a \"special message\" two hours before Mr Blair speaks. The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes Shimon Peres. Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal. Mr Blair\\'s appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the UK claim it is a calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation.\\n\\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates, the world\\'s richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. On Tuesday, Mr Gates pledged $750m (£400m) of his own money to support the cause. Mr Gates\\' company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsoft\\'s near monopoly on computer desktops. Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazil\\'s President Lula da Silva. The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux.

Past Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. In recent months, the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure. The CBO says it envisages a further \"orderly\" decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. But the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost US economic growth.\\n\\nThe budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 September 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. However, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president\\'s plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. Republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 September attacks and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of President George W Bush\\'s election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. But Democrats have accused the president of excluding Iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies.

Mr Bakrie told the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors\\' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. This aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. Most of this \\'normal aid\\' would be used to finance the country\\'s budget deficit.

Nevertheless, one of Mr Bakrie\\'s deputies, Mahendra Siregar, told AFP news agency that Indonesia was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. \"What is true is that we are still discussing... the Paris Club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium.

China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats.

Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.\\n\\nStill, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.\\n\\nDespite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. \"There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,\" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings.\\n\\nChina\\'s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas.

European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\\n\\nThe Act comes into force in mid-2005.

There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.\\n\\nThe 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.\\n\\n\"We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without turning the US market into \"one with no exit\", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act\\'s least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm\\'s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (£374m).\\n\\nA delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.\\n\\nIt was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UK\\'s Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (£558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.',\n",

But when asked about their own family\\'s financial outlook, a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. Almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll, which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster. The poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill, compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. Those surveyed in three countries were split. In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving. Similarly, 48% were pessimistic about their national economy, while 41% were optimistic. And 47% saw their family\\'s economic conditions improving, as against 36% who said they were getting worse.\\n\\nThe poll of 22,953 people was conducted by the international polling firm GlobeScan, together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes (Pipa) at the University of Maryland. \"While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing its effects,\" said Pipa director Steven Kull. \"People around the world are saying: \\'I\\'m OK, but the world isn\\'t\\'.\" There may be a perception that war, terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place, even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance, says the BBC\\'s Elizabeth Blunt.\\n\\nThe countries where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, China and India, followed by Indonesia. China has seen two decades of blistering economic growth, which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale, says the BBC\\'s Louisa Lim in Beijing. But the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country\\'s rosy economic future, our correspondent says. South Korea was the most pessimistic, while respondents in Italy and Mexico were also quite gloomy. The BBC\\'s David Willey in Rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001, which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents\\' families, but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. Pipa conducted the poll from 15 November 2004 to 3 January 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. The interviews took place between 15 November 2004 and 5 January 2005. The margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points, depending on the country. In eight of the countries, the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.',\n",

The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n\\nThey shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n\\nHowever, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n\\nChina's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\",\n",

The government has rejected the 60% rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos ($136m; £72.3m) in improvements. Planning Minister Julio De Vido has offered State help but not for \"free\".\\n\\nMr De Vido said that the Argentine state would not make a contribution \"in the form of a subsidy\".\\n\\nHe has said a contribution could be made in return for a seat on the company\\'s board. He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a State contribution is agreed. However, Aguas Argentinas told the Argentine newspaper Clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and, in practice, this rules out State participation on its board. The Planning Minister didn\\'t rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession. Yet he added that he didn\\'t like to do \"futurology\". But last week, Argentine Economic Minister, Roberto Lavagna, told the French media in Paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments. Speaking in Buenos Aires, Mr De Vido later denied the possibility of any tariff increase and insisted that the annual investment in water infrastructure was at the centre of the discussions. He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided. Suez owns 40% of Aguas Argentinas (39.9%), while Spain\\'s Aguas de Barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 25.01%. Recently, Suez lost a water concession in Bolivia after mass protests in the city of El Alto (the poorest in the country), with citizens complaining of unfair water charges. This forced the government to cancel the contract.\\n\\nIn Argentina, Suez\\'s subsidiary, which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water, has maintained a tense relationship with the Argentine government. During the last financial crisis in Argentina, the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from US dollars to pesos, and then freezing them during devaluation, had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations. When President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina arrived in power he began to negotiate a solution to the disagreements with international utilities operating in Argentina. But he has rejected any tariff increases, alleging this will impoverish citizens further. He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water. On May 2004, Aguas Argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its Buenos Aires water-concession contract. The firm agreed to invest 242m pesos. The issue has attracted European interest. Last week in Paris, President Kirchner discussed this problem and other issues with French president Jacques Chirac. The Argentine government is also under pressure from European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to raise utilities tariffs, because most of the utilities operating in Argentina are European.',\n",

In 2003, the US was ahead with 20.5% and China came second with 19.2%. The change highlights China's growing importance as an economic powerhouse. In 2004, Japan's imports from and exports to China (and Hong Kong) added up to 22,201bn yen ($214.6bn;£114.5bn). This is the highest figure for Japanese trade with China since records began in 1947. It compares with 20,479.5bn yen in trade with the US.\\n\\nTrade with the US during 2004 was hurt by one-off factors, including a 13-month ban on US beef imports following the discovery of a cow infected with mad cow disease (BSE) in the US. However, economists predict China will become an even more important Japanese trading partner in the coming years. On Tuesday, figures showed China's economy grew by 9.5% in 2004 and experts say the overall growth picture remains strong. Analysts see two spurs to future growth as being China's membership of the World Trade Organisation and lower trade tariffs. During 2004, Japan's trade surplus grew 17.9% to 12.011 trillion yen, with more than half the surplus, 6.962 trillion yen, accounted for by its trade with the US. In December, the surplus grew 1.8% on a year ago to 1.14 trillion yen thanks to stronger-than-expected exports.\",\n",

As he arrived at Spain\\'s High Court earlier on Wednesday, Mr Botin greeted the waiting media, saying: \"I have full faith in justice.\" Santander\\'s board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman, saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support. But if convicted, Mr Botin could face a prison term of up to six years. Mr Corcostegui, a former CEO at Santander, also asked the court for new evidence to be admitted. In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the £8.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National. Since taking over the chairmanship in 1986, he has turned Santander into one of the top ten biggest banks in the world.',\n",

The ONS says gross domestic product (GDP) rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 December, compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter. The rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst Christmas for retailers in decades.\\n\\nThe annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. Growth in the final three months of 2004 marked the 50th consecutive quarter of expansion. \"On the basis of the latest information the UK has entered 2005 on course to continue its record period of growth,\" said Paul Boateng, chief secretary to the Treasury in a statement.\\n\\nThe ONS said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter. The strong services figure was welcomed by analysts, given lacklustre retail sales in December and across the Christmas holiday period. \"The fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and I am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,\" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS Financial Markets.\\n\\nHowever, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. However the ONS would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. But Steve Radley, chief economist at the manufacturers\\' organisation EEF, said: \"These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. \"Whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year, \\'recession\\' is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise.\" The ONS said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.\\n\\nSimon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: \"This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy.\" And he said the GDP figures may help to \"push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve\". \"The suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. This is consistent with our own thinking,\" said Mr Rubinsohn. The Bank of England\\'s nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at 4.75%, minutes of the meeting showed on Wednesday.',\n",

There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\\n\\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\\n\\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC\\'s global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\\n\\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won\\'t kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\\n\\n\\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.',\n",

It claims this was later covered up by the Church. The Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, described the novel as a \"great thriller\" but \"lousy history\". The book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. Despite enjoying Dan Brown\\'s conspiracy theory, the Bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.\\n\\nWriting his Christmas message in the Northern Echo, the Bishop said: \"Conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. \"Dan Brown is the best writer I\\'ve come across in the genre, but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable.\" A great deal of credible evidence proves the Biblical version of Jesus\\' life was true, according to the Bishop. \"The evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity is astonishingly good,\" he said. \"We have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the New Testament than we have for the main classical authors like Cicero, Virgil and Tacitus.\\n\\n\"Historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of Jesus, with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don\\'t fit the world of later legend.\" Brown\\'s book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the UK and US. The Da Vinci Code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims. The book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is set to be made into a film starring Tom Hanks.',\n",

He served as a pilot with the Royal Air Force during World War II, flying fighter planes to the Middle East. It was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut, the television screenplay Flight into Danger. Hailey emigrated to Canada in 1947, where he eventually became a citizen. He wanted to be a writer from an early age, but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties, when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to Toronto.\\n\\n\"I fell to daydreaming. I visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick. Could I fly the airplane? I was a rusty wartime pilot who hadn\\'t flown for nine years... \" Hailey later recalled. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought Flight into Danger for $600 (£318) and it was shown on TV in April 1956. It was later memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy Airplane!, starring Leslie Nielsen. Hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years, before turning to novels. He went on to produce 11 best-selling books, which were published into 38 languages in 40 countries. Flight into Danger was adapted to become Hailey\\'s first novel, Runaway Zero-Eight in 1958. The Final Diagnosis and In High Places followed, both achieving a popular following. But it was not until Hotel, in 1965, that Hollywood came calling. The hit novel took four years to write, and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. It was turned into a movie in 1967 and later adapted into a glossy soap in the 1980s, starring James Brolin. Airport (1968) arguably remains Hailey\\'s best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. The thriller follows events in the sky, and on the ground at a snow-logged airport, when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb.\\n\\nThe book was adapted into a hit film in 1970, starring Burt Lancaster as the harassed aiport manager and Dean Martin as a womanising pilot, alongside Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset. In a testament to the popularity of the fledgling disaster genre - three sequels followed. The writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred, drawing his characters \"from real life\" and taking up to three years to produce each book. \"I have never been able to write quickly or easily. I am too self-critical for that. I am never satisfied,\" he once said. In 1969, he moved to Nassau in the Bahamas, with his wife Sheila. Wheels (1971), The Moneychangers (1975) and Overload (1979) followed. Despite a lukewarm response from critics, and few literary accolades, Hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of Hollywood producers. Strong Medicine, Hailey\\'s blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, was turned into a film in 1986, starring Sam Neill, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a panoply of former soap stars. The 1997 novel Detective proved to be Hailey\\'s final book, when at the age of 77 he decided to retire. Hailey\\'s health began to deteriorate in recent years, twice undergoing heart surgery. He suffered a stroke just two months ago. He died in his sleep on Wednesday, after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in New Providence island. \"He had a wonderful life. His greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that,\" said his wife, Sheila.',\n",

Her parents were comfortably off - her father, a mining engineer, drove a Rolls Royce. When she was eight, her mother took a decision which changed her life. Fearing that she had flat feet and weak legs, she arranged for her to have ballet lessons. Very quickly it became apparent that she was something special. She was spotted by the Russian artistic impresario, Sergei Diaghilev, who wanted her to dance for his company, Ballets Russes. She became ill with diphtheria but kept in touch, and, eventually, with a governess in tow, joined Diaghilev in Monte Carlo when she was 14.\\n\\nFrom here, she toured Europe, playing in all the top venues. It was Diaghilev who changed her name without even consulting her. Her life was one of great excitement. People such as Matisse and Stravinsky became like uncles to her, the latter put in charge of her musical education. Soon after Diaghilev\\'s death in 1929, Alicia Markova returned to England and became Britain\\'s first international ballerina. She helped launch the Ballet Club at the Mercury Theatre (later the Ballet Rambert), the Vic Wells Ballet, and then, with Anton Dolin, the Markova-Dolin Ballet of 1935-37. She also began working with young choreographers such as Anthony Tudor and Frederick Ashton who became huge influences on the direction of ballet in the west.\\n\\nHer version of Giselle, all lightness and grace, is still considered to be among the finest ever. She was also outstanding in The Dying Swan. She was one of the first British ballerinas to take a major part in Les Sylphides. She, above all, helped popularise ballet both in Britain and in America.\\n\\nAlicia Markova spent World War II in the United States where, in a re-formed Ballets Russes, she played to huge audiences. She even appeared in Hollywood movies. In 1950, back in England, she and Anton Dolin jointly established the Festival Ballet. She retired in 1963, an \"instant decision\" she said, \"largely because of a leg injury\". Created a Dame, she made a new career for herself as a teacher. She also travelled the world directing ballet companies and putting on shows. She became director of ballet for the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in New York, and for some years was full-time Professor of Ballet and Performing Arts in the University of Cincinnati. A critic once said of Dame Alicia Markova\\'s dancing: \"She gave the illusion of moving as if she had no weight to get off the ground.\"',\n",

The organisation blames the growing popularity of computer games and other changes in lifestyle. And there are fears that if the trend is not reversed, there could be fewer British ballet stars in the future. The RAD found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70% after the age of 10 or 11. Dance teacher Eve Trew, who has taught ballet for over 48 years, told BBC News she had seen a \"vast\" change over the years. She blamed modern lifestyles for the fall in ballet attendance. \"I think the children of many years ago did not have as many hobbies,\" she said. \"The trouble now is that they are wide open to computers, Gameboys and everything else children have got. \"As a result, there is less time being spent on ballet lessons.\"\\n\\nHazel Gilbert, 23, an information manager from Newcastle, gave up ballet at the age of 10 and is typical of the problem. \"It\\'s not a very cool thing to do when you go to \\'big\\' school and I think you have to be very focused on ballet to want to carry on doing it,\" she said. \"I used to love it, but after a certain age it becomes much more disciplined and I didn\\'t want that. \"I started getting into other things, like swimming and kickboxing, and ballet just wasn\\'t something I wanted to do any more.\" Ms Trew, who runs a dance school in Gateshead, admitted it would be \"very difficult\" to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing to make the sacrifices to succeed. \"You have to be very dedicated and you have to be very disciplined. \"It is a career that you have got to really want to do because it is such hard work. \"Children these days have not got the time to spend perfecting it... that is very sad.\"\\n\\nCurrently, only two out of 16 principal dancers at the Royal Ballet - Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope - are British, compared to 16 of the 21 principals in 1985. But a spokesman for the English National Ballet told BBC News that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were British, around a quarter of the company\\'s dancers were from the UK. He said competition at open auditions in London was \"fierce\" between talented dancers from all over the world. The RAD have launched a new competition to try and reverse the decline in British ballet. Dame Antoinette Sibley, president of the RAD, launched the Fonteyn Nureyev Young Dancers competition earlier this week.\\n\\nAimed at children aged 10 to 13, it is hoped the contest will help keep British ballet evolving. A spokeswoman for the RAD said: \"It is our responsibility to re-ignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the long-term future of ballet. \"We need to provide them with a framework and a goal to work towards, with constant support and coaching in an environment where they can work with their peers and possibly leading artists and choreographers. \"Perhaps more importantly provide them with the opportunity to experience \\'performance\\' themselves. \"What better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance?\"',\n",

One fiction judge, Stewart O\\'Nan, carried around a note written on a napkin that said: \"I would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books, not an enemy.\" The National Book Awards non-fiction prize was awarded to Kevin Boyle\\'s for Arc of Justice, which focuses on a black family\\'s fight to live in a white Detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s.

Now in its twenty-first year, Sundance continues to grow. Some 45,000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind. It\\'s an opportunity to meet and make deals. Redford wanted Sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers, but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream.\\n\\nSmaller festivals like Slamdance and XDance, which take place during the same week in Park City, are competing for Sundance\\'s limelight. But Redford is not worried. \"The more the merrier,\" he says. \"The point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them. \"Once independent film had a place where the work could be seen, suddenly the merchants came. With them the celebrities came, then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone,\" explains Redford.\\n\\n\"People started to say we had gone mainstream and Hollywood, but actually Hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film,\" he adds. International film-makers have always been celebrated here, but 2005 is the first year a dedicated World Dramatic and Documentary competition is being held.\\n\\nRedford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the American media fails to reflect, particularly how the US is perceived internationally. He has never hidden the fact that he is a Democrat. But he reserves particular disdain for the current Republican administration. \"It\\'s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration,\" he says. \"I think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. That\\'s very unhealthy and very dangerous.\\n\\n\"If we take that policy into the world, there will be the same victims and the same consequences.\" Sundance isn\\'t just one big screening. There are discussion panels and Q&A sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like America\\'s \"culture wars\" and the Iraq war. While Redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent, the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic. Educated, middle class and predominantly white Americans comes Sundance, with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. But Redford knows this and started the Sundance TV Channel in an effort to reach a wider audience. \"When you look at the films here, what we are presenting is very much egalitarian. And it\\'s about good films and good story-telling be it African America, Asian, women, gay, lesbian. \"Sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say \\'it\\'s just a film by so-and so\\'.\"',\n",

It is all part of the progression of Harry's story into darker areas, but you'll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful Hogwarts landscape.\\n\\nThis is the first Potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book. It is the third year at Hogwarts and studies are interrupted, as they always are, by a calamity that only Harry, Ron and Hermione can put right.\\n\\nIt sounds corny. But Harry is no longer the winsome hero, he is a moody teenager and Daniel Radcliffe pulls it off very well. Emma Watson is ever better as Hermione, and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson. The film itself is the reason to buy this DVD. But it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras, including funny, if shallow, interviews with all the main cast. But what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch. Younger viewers will go for the games which include a Magic You May Have Missed memory test, and Crookshanks chasing off after Scabbers. Adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes. You will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage - and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it, as we did on the first Harry Potter DVD. The most interesting pieces are an interview with JK Rowling in Creating The Vision and Conjuring A Scene, a short featurette about the making of the film's big moments.\",\n",

Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\\n\\nAmpas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards.

But 36 people accused in connection with the blasts said it should not be screened until the trial is over. Mumbai High Court postponed the film\\'s launch until 3 February.\\n\\nBlack Friday is based upon the novel of the same name written by journalist S Hussain Zaidi, which looks at the 15 explosions which rocked Mumbai on 12 March 1993. Director Anurag Kashyap said the film\\'s release should not be delayed as the book has already been on sale for two years. \"If you have not gone against the book, then how can you go against the movie?\" Mr Kashyap\\'s lawyer Mihir Desai said. This is the second time that those accused in connection with the blasts have sought legal intervention regarding the film.\\n\\nThey previously asked that a line from the movie\\'s poster, which claimed the film portrayed \"the true story of the Bombay bomb blasts\", be removed. Their lawyer, Majeed Memon, said: \"We had argued that how can a film say it is telling the true story when the court itself is struggling to find the truth? \"So we said they should remove the line from their promotional posters and they did give us an assurance that they would do so.\" The Mumbai bombings case is one of India\\'s longest-running trials. A special court was set up to hear the case and regular hearings have taken place there for the last nine years, with more than six hundred witnesses questioned.',\n",

The actor repeatedly refused, throwing the book at her and saying: \"For the last time, I won\\'t glorify the mafia\". But Brando, who died last July at the age of 80, eventually took the role of Don Corleone, winning him an Oscar in 1973 which he notoriously refused.

Every time she went to see Brando from then on, she added, he was wearing a different gangster-style moustache. Brando was asked to screen test for the role in The Godfather, as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of Brando\\'s previous film Mutiny on the Bounty . In fact Brando\\'s Academy Award triumph revived his career. The actor was nominated for an Oscar the following year for his role in Bernardo Bertolucci\\'s Last Tango in Paris.

Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago. A Dutch-Moroccan man suspected of radical Islamist links has been charged. The killing, and Fortuyn's death in 2002, convulsed the Netherlands. Many Dutch people have questioned their country's self-image as a peaceful, tolerant nation in the wake of the murders, which triggered heated debate about immigration.\\n\\nAn animal rights activist was sentenced to 18 years in prison last year for killing Fortuyn. Earlier this year, Van Gogh made a film accusing Islam of promoting violence against women. It caused outrage among Muslims and death threats were made against him. The film 06/05 will become available on the internet on Wednesday and go on general release in Dutch cinemas in January. Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician. The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder. Photographer Jim de Booy then goes on the run from secret service agents who burgle his home and threaten his family.\",\n",

Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film\\'s second half. \"It was serendipity really - I was offered Vanity Fair by the studio Focus Features, who had distributed Monsoon Wedding,\" Nair told BBC World Service\\'s Masterpiece programme. \"They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India.\"\\n\\nSince her 1988 debut feature Salaam Bombay! - nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar and winner of Best First Feature at Cannes - Nair has become one of India\\'s most famous and respected directors. She is not restricted to Bollywood, however - she followed Salaam Bombay! with Mississippi Masala, starring Denzel Washington, and The Perez Family, her first Hollywood film.\\n\\nHer career peaked with Monsoon Wedding in 2001, which won the Golden Lion award at Venice. Nair\\'s Indian-style adaptation of Vanity Fair, however, has been attacked by critics in the US - where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week - who described the Bollywood elements as \"jarring.\" The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India. But Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray - who was born in India but moved to England as a young man - had seen the world. \"First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,\" she said. \"But it was the sort of novel I somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years, and I would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again. \"As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray\\'s clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider. \"That perspective was something I really loved.\"\\n\\nNair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish. \"I cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors,\" she said. \"For me, it is intuition - I have to fall in love with an actor. It is a visceral response.\\n\\n\"Thackeray describes Becky Sharp as a minx. Also she\\'s described as someone who\\'s tiny, red-headed and thin. Reese had that completely minx-like irresistibility about her.\" Having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part, however, Witherspoon then became pregnant. But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film. \"It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said \\'knock her up, won\\'t you, I need some flesh on the girl\\',\" she joked. \"I\\'m not a fan of the underfed Los Angeles actor at all. This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film. \"I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with.\" Nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise Witherspoon\\'s \"bump\" in various scenes - including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her. \"She runs, she gets off coal carts, she jumps off horses - she does everything,\" Nair said. \"But there\\'s also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment, because of the bump.\"',\n",

UK critics still favour The Aviator for best film, but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.\\n\\nScorsese has never won the best director prize, despite four previous nominations for films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Gangs of New York.

However, he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on US TV.\\n\\nHe also played down fears that Rock, who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines, might cause controversy on the night. The 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show. \"Chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously,\" Cates said. \"You need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show.\" Security will also be tight, with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas. \"We are pulling out all the stops,\" said John Miller, chief of counterterrorism at the Los Angeles Police Department.

Traditionally, ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. According to Exhibitor Relations President Paul Dergarabedian, the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004, compared to $5.80 in 2002. This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.\\n\\n\"Many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money,\" said Mr Dergarabedian. He added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as Napoleon Dynamite and critical hit Sideways. Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice chairman. Jeff Blake said: \"We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge.\" Horror movie The Grudge cost Sony $10 million to make but brought in $110 million. It\\'s the latest in a recent trend for Hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market, whilst ignoring the middle. Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three.',\n",

              " {'sequence': \"DVD review: Spider-Man 2\\n\\nIt's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. But Spider-Man 2 breaks that rule in two.\\n\\nIt's not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of Spidey versus Doc Ock and more so into the fate of poor Peter Parker. Gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. A few effects look false but Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina make this compelling. The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects. This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. Then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.\\n\\nSometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man.\\n\\nNow is that a Christmas present or what? Give this to someone on 24 December and you won't see them again until early in the New Year. It's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward Wayne's earlier films: there's no True Grit, for instance, though there is Hellraisers. The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras.\\n\\nIt was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that's been long awaited on DVD. This set has the first season of Buck (Gil Gerard) and Wilma's (Erin Gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember. But it's also a disappointment. The US DVD has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. The bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras. That's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars Gerard and Gray had agreed to do them.\",\n",

Its star Hilary Swank is favourite to win best actress while Jamie Foxx is tipped to win best actor for Ray. Million Dollar Baby has seven nominations while The Aviator has 11. The Aviator has scored a best director nomination for Martin Scorsese, who has never won an Oscar, while stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett are both nominated for acting Oscars.\\n\\n\"If you look at the Oscars race, The Aviator should be ahead,\" said awards pundit Tom O\\'Neil. \"It is the most nominated film, and the most nominated movie has won best picture 18 times out of the last 20 years. \"But the reality is Million Dollar Baby is the dark horse. People feel emotionally about it and Clint is a beloved Hollywood chum of the Academy voters,\" he said. Anne Thompson of the Hollywood Reporter said that Million Dollar Baby was \"heart-wrenching\". \"It\\'s very emotional, it even makes grown men cry,\" she said. \"The Aviator is a gorgeous movie, but it\\'s colder.\"\\n\\nIn the acting categories, Foxx is regarded as almost unbeatable for his performance as Ray Charles in Ray. \"The performance is based on a real person who was a showbusiness hero with a handicap, who recently died,\" O\\'Neil said. \"He has unstoppable momentum among the voters.\" Hilary Swank is the favourite to win best actress for the second time in six years. She previously won in 1999 for her performance in Boys Don\\'t Cry. In the supporting categories, Cate Blanchett is tipped to win for her performance as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, while Morgan Freeman is favourite to take home his first ever Oscar, for Million Dollar Baby.

But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.\\n\\nUp to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\\n\\nAmpas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive committee on Wednesday. The decision also saw Clint Eastwood get his third personal nomination for Million Dollar Baby. He is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. The Academy Awards ceremony will be held in Hollywood on 27 February.

Scholl, 21, was arrested and beheaded with her brother, Hans, in 1943 for distributing leaflets condemning the \"abhorrent tyranny\" of Adolf Hitler. Director Marc Rothemund said: \"I have a feeling of responsibility to keep the legacy of the Scholls going.\" \"We must somehow keep their ideas alive,\" he added.\\n\\nThe film drew on transcripts of Gestapo interrogations and Scholl\\'s trial preserved in the archive of communist East Germany\\'s secret police. Their discovery was the inspiration behind the film for Rothemund, who worked closely with surviving relatives, including one of Scholl\\'s sisters, to ensure historical accuracy on the film. Scholl and other members of the White Rose resistance group first started distributing anti-Nazi leaflets in the summer of 1942. They were arrested as they dropped leaflets at Munich University calling for a \"day of reckoning\" with Adolf Hitler\\'s regime. The film focuses on the six days from Scholl\\'s arrest to the intense trial which saw Scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance. It is one of three German films vying for a top prize at the Festival.\\n\\nA South African film version of Bizet\\'s tragic opera Carmen shot in Cape Town in the Xhosa language has also premiered at the Berlin Festival. The film is entitled U-Carmen eKhayelitsha or Carmen in Khayelitsha after the township in which the story is set. It is performed by a 40-strong music and theatre troupe in their debut film performance. The film is the first South African feature in 25 years and only the second to be nominated for a Golden Bear Award.',\n",

Weitz, who directed American Pie and About A Boy, said New Line feared that any anti-religiosity in the film would make the project \"unviable financially\". He said: \"All my best efforts will be directed towards keeping the film as liberating and iconoclastic an experience as I can. \"But there may be some modification of terms.\"\\n\\nWeitz said he had visited Pullman, who had told him that the Authority could \"represent any arbitrary establishment that curtails the freedom of the individual, whether it be religious, political, totalitarian, fundamentalist, communist, what have you\". He added: \"I have no desire to change the nature or intentions of the villains of the piece, but they may appear in more subtle guises.\" There are a number of Christian websites which attack the trilogy for their depiction of the church and of God, but Pullman has denied his books are anti-religious. His agent told the Times newspaper that Pullman was happy with the adaptation so far. \"Of course New Line want to make money, but Mr Weitz is a wonderful director and Philip is very supportive. \"You have to recognise that it is a challenge in the climate of Bush\\'s America,\"',\n",

But his lawyer said the money could not be raised on time. Mr Doherty, 25, was arrested following an alleged incident in a London hotel on Wednesday evening. Musician Alan Wass, 23, also of north London, appeared in court accused of the same offences.\\n\\nMagistrates imposed a range of bail conditions on Mr Doherty including a curfew between 2200 and 0700, except when he attends a drug rehabilitation centre. He was told he would not be able to leave his home without being accompanied by a security firm. He must also surrender his passport and report daily to a local police station. Mr Wass was also given a curfew and told to surrender his passport. Mr Doherty left The Libertines at the end of June 2004, but continued performing with his band Babyshambles. The singer, who has been linked to supermodel Kate Moss, was arrested after police were called to the Islington hotel in response to claims that a man had been assaulted. A man in his 30s was later taken to University College Hospital, London, with facial injuries, before being discharged. A lawyer representing Mr Doherty and Mr Wass said outside court the pair strenuously denied the charges.',\n",

It was one of the last dates he did in London.\"\\n\\n: The album Exodus came out in 1977 and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status. \"By 1979 he was the biggest touring attraction in the world. I remember going to see dates in Milan and Turin and they were enormous concerts.\"\\n\\n: Bob was one of the most mesmeric people I\\'ve ever had the privilege to work with. \"He must have had an iron will to succeed. Bob was a very driven individual. You realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in. He didn\\'t suffer fools gladly. At the risk of stating the obvious, he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest I\\'ve ever seen. I saw him many times.\"\\n\\n: \"I recall in 1978 he came to the UK for Top of the Pops and a Daily Mirror journalist did a half-hour interview. It was interrupted to do a rehearsal.

His team assembled wherever his gigs were. We played in Brazil against some World Cup-winning players.\"\\n\\n: It was always a struggle for him to connect with Black America.

Last month the Brit Awards announced they would no longer be awarding a Best Dance Act prize, with the Brits committee announcing that \"dance music is no longer where it\\'s happening in music.\" These developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. Cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album, Halfway Between The Gutter And The Stars, but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. \"Every week when I was making the album, I was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat,\" he told BBC World Service\\'s The Ticket programme. \"I personally don\\'t believe it\\'s either dead or going to die, but it\\'s going through a bit of a fallow patch. \"So I think, consciously or subconsciously, reading every week that dance music was dead I would think \\'right, scrub that track then\\'.\"\\n\\nAlthough his album sales in the UK are down - Palookaville stayed in the UK top 75 for just three weeks - Cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. And event on Brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250,000, people, while a later one in Rio achieved a crowd of 360,000. The DVD of the Rio set was the biggest seller of that year.\\n\\n\"With a crowd that big, if the weather\\'s nice, the atmosphere before I even go is so good that about halfway through the first record I think \\'I\\'ve got them\\',\" Cook said. \"I\\'m always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me Valium before Rio, because two hours before I was literally just pacing the floor. \"For some reason, especially now I\\'ve got a reputation for it, the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that\\'s already going on means all I have to do is play \\'up\\' records.\" He promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the Brighton event, which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. One man also died of a heart attack, and a woman fell to her death during the free party. \"We\\'re having to widen our horizons from just beaches, because there\\'s landlocked countries that want to get involved,\" Cook said. \"We\\'re doing Rio at the carnival, at the Maracana, and Sao Paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums.\"\\n\\nThe DJ admitted, however, that his massive worldwide success had a downside, with intense media interest in his personal life. In particular, he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to Radio One presenter Zoe Ball, after she was linked with DJ Dan Peppe.\\n\\n\"The tabloid thing has been difficult at times,\" Cook said. \"Especially the me-and-Zoe-Gate - it\\'s quite scary.\" He said that he had been \"determined\" that what had happened with Ball did not affect the album. \"At first I was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn\\'t think I was depressed,\" he explained. \"Then I thought, \\'that\\'s not right\\'.\" And he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended. \"I said to Zoe, \\'I did this track called My Masochistic Baby Went And Left Me, do you mind if it\\'s on the album?\\'\" he recalled. \"She said, \\'yeah, it\\'s hilarious, because your masochistic baby did leave you\\'.\" Cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure, which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where Paul McCartney is a neighbour. \"It\\'s almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs,\" Cook explained. \"If there\\'s a pap at the end of the road, everyone knocks on each other\\'s doors - Paul comes round, and we warn him, because we don\\'t know who they\\'re after.\"',\n",

Other music stars being approached include Robin and Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees, jazz sensation Jamie Cullum, Chris Rea and Olivia Newton-John.\\n\\nSir Cliff has recorded his vocal part in Barbados, while Boy George has recorded his in New York. Read wrote the song before the Boxing Day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release.

The backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible. Read went to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which is co-ordinating the British relief effort, with the idea the day after Boxing Day. \"I was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents,\" he said.

But Kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with MPs, at the University of Edinburgh event. \"I think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them,\" he said.\\n\\nKapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotland\\'s role in making 21st Century music. \"There are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren\\'t self-sufficient,\" he said. \"But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.\" He warned musicians against being allied to a particular party, however. \"I don\\'t know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea.\"\\n\\nKapranos and his Glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week\\'s Brit Awards, including best group and best album. Their self-titled debut album won last year\\'s Mercury Music Prize and spawned three top 20 singles. He told the 300-strong audience at the University\\'s Reid Hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes. \"We say \\'I like this\\'. Because I listen to Nirvana and Korn I am a troubled individual, I\\'m riddled with angst because I listen to Chopin and Debussy, I listen to Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters because I\\'m upbeat and I like to party, I listen to Wagner because I like the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Kapranos said there was a general \"hostility\" towards classical music, adding: \"There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM.\"\\n\\nHe concluded: \"We define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity.\" Fellow speaker and classical composer James MacMillan agreed: \"We need to rediscover our ability to listen.\" Previous speakers at the Edinburgh Lectures series have included former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and author Professor Stephen Hawking. Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as \"more daunting by a long way\" than their upcoming Brits performance. \"I don\\'t really care about the Brits,\" he said. \"It\\'s going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight.\"\\n\\nI think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.\\n\\nRather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out, why don\\'t some of the megastars put something back in? Some of Britain\\'s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. There are far more important demands on government funds.\\n\\nIf they can fund football, why not fund music?\\n\\nAreas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.\\n\\nThe government has enough problems funding schools and health services. If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.\\n\\nAs a Scot living in England, I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success, so I can see no problem with it! Franz Ferdinand, Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods!\\n\\nI think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? The answer is most definitely no. Those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn\\'t be looking for government subsidies. I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.\\n\\nYes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.\\n\\nThere are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the \"new deal\". Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.\\n\\nAs long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move. I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.\\n\\nOnly if the proposals make financial sense. Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they\\'d had a government grant to get started they\\'d have more than paid it back by now, so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out. However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they\\'re a musician. The government shouldn\\'t \"fund\" music - it should \"invest\" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.\\n\\nI think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.\\n\\nI do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn\\'t have to fork out a great deal.\\n\\nYeah, why not? Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities\\n\\nI agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. Call it a tax on music \"pollution\", if you like.\\n\\nThough I really like Franz Ferdinand, I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos. Once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US.',\n",

Andre 3000 and Big Boi\\'s album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world. The double album - which saw the pair produce one disc each - topped the charts in the US at the same time as single Hey Ya! It took another track from the exponents of southern hip-hop - The Way You Move - to displace it from the top spot. The Georgia pair\\'s year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow - what can be next for a musical act that has done it all?\\n\\nG Money, a presenter on the BBC\\'s urban music station 1Xtra, thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure - giving the band time to think about other interests. \"They might be more appearances outside the band, such as producing for other artists, while they have a number of fringe music projects. \"Andre 3000 would like to go into acting, so we might see him a film, while Big Boi already has a dog-breeding business,\" says the DJ.\\n\\n\"But in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double CD. \"Their greatness has become clear with Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.

OutKast\\'s musical career spans 10 years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past, with their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum.

Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine. Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\\n\\nThree years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson\\'s headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\\n\\nEarlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night\\'s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs. After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year\\'s half-time show. His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.',\n",

Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine. Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\\n\\nThree years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson\\'s headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\\n\\nEarlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night\\'s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs. After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year\\'s half-time show. His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.',\n",

Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed. But the US Court of Appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.\\n\\nSampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton\\'s recording. That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the Beastie Boys. \"We hold that Beastie Boys\\' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton\\'s copyright,\" Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion. Mr Newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist, composer, performer, and university professor. Mr Newton and the Beastie Boys were not available for comment.',\n",

British Music Rights (BMR) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack.\\n\\nSongwriter Guy Chambers, who has worked with stars including Robbie Williams, has thrown his support behind the scheme.

At a debate in London to launch the scheme, Chambers said: \"I think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools. \"These lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers.\" The education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. It will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry, particularly in the digital age.\\n\\nHenri Yoxall, general manager of British Music Rights, told BBC News schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. The scheme - which is an extension of BMR\\'s Respect the Value of Music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters Feargal Sharkey, Lucie Silvas and Grammy Award-winning composer David Arnold. Silvas said: \"I think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age. \"I wish I had been given an opportunity like this when I was at school.\" Emma Pike, director general of British Music Rights, said: \"We believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools. It is vital that the creatives of the future know how to turn their ideas into value. \"Copyright education has always been important... creatives are facing more challenges and more opportunities from technological change. \"Technology is allowing people to create music and distribute their music to the public in a whole host of new ways.\"',\n",

The money raised will also be used to help combat HIV and Aids across the continent. The Band Aid Trust which was set up 20 years ago, when the original single was released, handed out $144m (£75m) to famine relief projects across Africa between January 1985 and November 2004.\",\n",

The proposal, unveiled in the House of Representatives, also seeks to revoke a broadcaster\\'s licence after three violations have been committed. The exposure of Janet Jackson\\'s breast at last year\\'s Superbowl landed CBS with a $550,000 (£293,264) fine. Entertainers could also be liable for fines under the proposed legisation from both US politcians and officials from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A Republican senator from Kansas, Sam Brownbeck, is set to call for a maximum $3 million (£1.6 million) fine for repeated violations.\\n\\nThe current maximum fine stands at $32,500 (£17,320) - 20 of the stations in the CBS network were each penalised these lesser amounts for the Jackson incident. Republican politician Fred Upton, who chairs the committee responsible for broadcasting, said current fines are \"more of a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent\". Last year\\'s Janet Jackson \\'wardrobe malfunction\\' encouraged the FCC to impose tougher rules, but the US Congress adjourned last year without agreeing on a new level of fines. New figures have to be decided before new legislation can be put before President Bush.

Among the items from his homes in Los Angeles and London were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past TV shows. Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: \"I just want to get rid of it all, it\\'s just a headache.\" He added: \"It feels good to be selling this stuff, it\\'s a weight off my mind. \"Look at it all, there\\'s so much clutter. I\\'ve enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it\\'s not important anymore.\" The normally gregarious Evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes, wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his Aladdin\\'s cave.\\n\\nHowever, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the British public in shows such as Channel 4\\'s gameshow Don\\'t Forget Your Toothbrush. The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. Sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. The elaborate nature of the pieces, many custom-made, had to be admired, particularly a huge red and gold upholstered \"throne\" and a stripy deckchair from the Queen Mary liner.\\n\\nTo help people in their browsing, Evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside. \"Isn\\'t it great\" was the comment on the £1,950 throne and \"Bob Dylan\\'s old sofa - honest\" was written on a dark wood couch priced £4,250.\\n\\nThe prices were steep by a lot of people\\'s standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers. \"I\\'ve sold quite a lot already. Everything here is on sale for less than I bought it for but it\\'s not really about the money. It\\'s about getting rid of it all. We\\'ve all been bartering, that\\'s what it\\'s all about.\" He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. Vintage TV and film posters also lined the walls, including a rare portrait of Raquel Welch and an original advertising print from the Benny Hill Show. And, almost hidden at the back of the lock-up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former Channel 4 show, although these were not for sale.\\n\\nDespite the sheer curiosity value of the sale, there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.\\n\\nPaul Burgess said: \"I didn\\'t realise. I thought it was just a load of junk. I should go back and have a better look.\" But local resident Francesca Detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of The Who by David Wedgburg. Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying £350 for the print. \"If you like something, you don\\'t really count it like that,\" she said.\\n\\nMartin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans\\' shop, said he thought it was a great idea. \"Why not, if you\\'ve got stuff to get rid of it\\'s a good place to do it,\" said Mr Hellewell. Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom.

They are also asking the Sci-Fi Channel to pick it up from UPN and will stage a rally in Los Angeles on 25 February.\\n\\nThe advert described the Star Trek franchise as a \"cultural icon\". Enterprise stars former Quantum Leap actor Scott Bakula as Captain Archer and is set before the original 1960s Star Trek series. \"Captain Archer and the crew of the NX-01 need your help to continue their journeys!\" the advert said. It also included a cut-out coupon for fans to send to UPN\\'s parent companies Paramount and Viacom plus the Sci-Fi Channel. It also urged supporters to join the rally outside the Paramount studios.\\n\\nFan website Trek United is hoping to raise $32m (£17m) from donations by the end of March to pay for a fifth series. More than $23,000 (£12,000) has been pledged so far, according to the site. The 98th and final episode of Star Trek: Enterprise will air in the US on 13 May. The fourth series has averaged 2.9 million viewers per episode - half the amount it got in its first series. Star Trek: Enterprise began in 2001 following other Star Trek spin-off series The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager.',\n",

The corporation said the new show \"aims to appeal to a diverse audience of music lovers\". The move is the biggest shake-up in the history of the show, which was first broadcast in 1964 and has always been on BBC One.

But despite the relaunch audience figures failed to rise and still remain around the three million mark. Tim Kash has since been replaced as host by Fearne Cotton. The new show will launch in Spring next year in an extended format. BBC Two controller Roly Keating: \"It\\'s an exciting new era for Top of the Pops. We want to make it bigger and better so that it becomes the ultimate pop music show for music lovers of every generation.\" Mr Keating described BBC Two as the \"natural home\" of Top of the Pops. He added: \"The addition of Top of the Pops will also extend BBC Two\\'s offering to younger audiences.\"\\n\\nA BBC spokeswoman said Andi Peters would continue as executive producer on the show. She said that issues over the exact format of the programme and a time slot were still to be decided. The programme will have a close relationship with the BBC Radio 1 chart show, which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on Sundays. \"Hopefully the audience for Top of the Pops will find it on BBC Two. \"We think that the new slot will create a buzz around the programme as for the first time viewers will discover the news of who is number one as it happens.\"',\n",

Lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used. The issue was discussed at a major science conference in Washington DC. Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) and its spin-offs, CSI: Miami and CSI: New York, have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.\\n\\nEach episode, a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal. \"The CSI effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the TV show,\" said Max Houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at West Virginia University, US. \"This TV show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof,\" he told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The American forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000-300,000 backlogged DNA samples in US labs. Yet these constituted just 10% of the total test backlog, said Dr Houck. Forensic pathologist Dr Patricia McFeeley said she had started to see the show\\'s influence in dealing with the families of victims. \"What I find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case,\" she explained. \"For example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. But when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult.\"\\n\\nDr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people\\'s perceptions. The show\\'s influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom, making lawyers jittery. \"Prosecutors fear the CSI effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: \\'why wasn\\'t everything tested?\\' Well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested,\" Dr Houck explained. \"Defence attorneys also worry about the CSI effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that\\'s always accurate.\" However, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. \"My university course started with four graduates in 1999; we\\'re now the largest major on campus - with 400 students,\" he said. Dr Houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: \"There\\'s more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.\"',\n",

Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name.

The agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said Richard Diamond, FCC deputy secretary of communications.

Although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated, the MPs said. The call was made in a report into the BBC\\'s Freeview digital service. \"Our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of EastEnders but simply to ensure that the BBC is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money,\" said the committee chairman, MP Edward Leigh. \"The BBC\\'s spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny, and accountability to parliament. \"Parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general, on behalf of parliament, to be able to scrutinise how that money, over £2 billion a year, is used.\"\\n\\nA BBC spokeswoman said: \"We share the committee\\'s interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well. Though in its infancy, we think the arrangements with the NAO are working well and should be given time to mature.\" The report said the Freeview digital service has had an \"impressive\" take up since its launch but the BBC must still dispel confusion about the service. The committee found the BBC had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002. But the fact that one in four homes could not access Freeview remained a problem.\\n\\nThe report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues, there was need for detailed explanations on the Freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas. The government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal, with 2012 the most recently proposed date. The BBC launched Freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as Sky, to allow its digital channels such as BBC Three and News 24 to be seen. There have been an estimated five million Freeview set-top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably. The corporation plans to spend up to £138m on Freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the UK, and are aware of it.',\n",

The renewed popularity for Ozzy has seen sales of his merchandise hit the $50m (£27.2m) mark, a record for a heavy metal artist. Sales of T-shirts, accessories and action figures have rocketed since The Osbournes hit screens. At its peak, The Osbournes had a regular audience of eight million, with America\\'s TV Guide magazine describing the series as \"a cross between The Simpsons and This Is Spinal Tap\". Osbourne himself was at a loss to explain its popularity: \"I suppose Americans get a kick out of watching a crazy Brit family like us make complete fools of ourselves every week.\"',\n",

It runs daily, not only on the television but also on the radio. Every Friday, hundreds of people gather in Luanda\\'s Independence Square to record a message in front of the TV cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it. Many relatives have been reunited on air. \"At the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds,\" Sergio Gera, the programme\\'s chief co-ordinator, told BBC World Service\\'s Assignment programme. \"Now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going.\"\\n\\nThe media in the southern African country, twice the size of France, has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. Hundreds of thousands of people died in Angola\\'s 30-year civil war, which finally ended in 2002, and tens of thousands of people are still missing. Many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all, 90% of Angolan families have lost someone.\\n\\nThe idea of recording in Independence Square was modelled on a square in the Argentine capital Buenos Aries, where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing, and to exchange news. One woman, Victoria Lapete, found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in Independence Square live on Meeting Point. She had not seen her sibling for 28 years. \"When we saw each other, we threw ourselves into each other\\'s arms,\" she told Assignment. \"We started to cry. I felt very, very happy, because I\\'d spent so long without any family. Suddenly I had a sister again.\" However, Angola is one of the poorest countries in Africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. This means that elsewhere in the country, the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In the city of Wambo, the ICRC runs the Gazetta - a 200-page, tabloid-size book which contains 13,000 names of missing or displaced.\\n\\nTheir task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country. \"It\\'s very difficult - there are many displaced,\" stated Joaquim Sahundi, head of tracing in Wambo.\\n\\n\"As they try to go back [home], others are trying to relocate their relatives. Many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages, in the bush, there has been no clearance of mines. \"When people are crossing these areas, they step on mines.\" The ICRC also uses the media where it can, running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on Radio Angola. Meanwhile, there remain massive challenges to Angolan families even once they are reunited. \"The programme of family reunification is extremely important, but for these families to remain reunified, there has to be social integration, job access, education, healthcare,\" said Rafael Marques of the pro-democracy George Soros Foundation for Southern Africa. \"Essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - that\\'s why it has been persistently calling for a donor\\'s conference. That is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities.\"',\n",

Radio 1 said the show would not try to replace Peel, but would rise to the \"challenge\" of \"keeping his legacy alive\" with unpredictable music. Peel died after suffering a heart attack in Peru in October. Radio 1 said the three DJs had been chosen for their \"in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres\". Rob Da Bank has been hosting The John Peel Show since the DJ\\'s death. He is also one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show that plays a mix of old and new electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens is currently one half of the Radio 1 Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up and coming acts breaking through in Wales. And Ras Kwame is the host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1\\'s digital station 1Xtra. His show is dedicated to showcasing the best of UK black music and broadcasts live sessions, often giving new artists their first chance to perform on live national radio.\\n\\nAll of the three DJs will continue to host their current shows on Radio 1. \"It is widely accepted that John Peel can never be replaced,\" said the radio station. It added that One Music would support both signed and unsigned talent, and said: \"It will seek out those making music for music\\'s sake rather than for commercial success. \"Above all it will provide support to emerging genres of music and styles that have not yet and may never reach the mainstream.\"\\n\\nOne Music is not new to Radio 1 as it already exists as a website, offering advice on aspects of the music industry, such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. Radio 1\\'s controller, Andy Parfitt, said: \"We believe that by having a series of DJs hosting a selection of shows under the One Music title, we will ensure that his legacy lives on.\" Stephens said he grew up \"listening to John\" and that it was a \"massive honour\" to continue Peel\\'s work championing new music. The show will be broadcast from 1 February on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2300 GMT - 0100 GMT.',\n",

They have risen to the head of the UK\\'s art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.\\n\\nOn the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry\\'s Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out.\\n\\nThe four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\".\\n\\n\"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where\\'s the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped.\\n\\nThe band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I\\'m really glad it was almost comical because we weren\\'t overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.',\n",

Confirmation of Busted\\'s long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day, when Simpson held a press conference in London with bandmates Matt Willis and James Bourne. All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was \"devastated\" to hear of Simpson\\'s departure. \"This has been a really difficult decision,\" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, \"I hope the fans will understand.\"\\n\\nWhile Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted\\'s enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday\\'s press conference coinciding with the start of the band\\'s 13-date tour of the UK. Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie\\'s first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick\\'s Student Union - sold out rapidly. Mike Eccleshall, the venue\\'s Promotions Coordinator, said: \"Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. We had completely sold out by 4pm.\"\\n\\nWith queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Support act Brigade, fronted by Simpson\\'s brother, played a short set first and were met with general approval. When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as Simpson\\'s guitar amplifier failed to work. As sound technicians rushed to fix it, other band members did their best to improvise. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar\\'s blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted\\'s chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: \"I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy. \"I\\'ve never heard them before, but I\\'m pretty impressed.\" Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, \"With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted\\'s sound, but they\\'re still not very inspiring.\" Fightstar played for around 45 minutes, showcasing material from their forthcoming EP called They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, due for release in February.',\n",

His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.\\n\\nFor his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band\\'s self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record\\'s artwork.\\n\\nAfter becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. But in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future.\\n\\nEdwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the band\\'s US tour to promote The Holy Bible. In the following days, police issue a missing person alert and his parents, Graham and Sherry, plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.\\n\\nPolice discover Edwards\\' car in a car park near the Severn Bridge near Bristol - a notorious suicide spot. The discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. The rest of the band stop touring and recording.\\n\\nThe band play their first concerts since Edwards\\' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour.\\n\\nThe Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards\\' disappearance. A Design For Life reaches number two in the UK singles chart. The album Everything Must Go follows.\\n\\nThe Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards.\\n\\nA fan says she saw Edwards in the hippy resort of Goa, India. Interpol are alerted but do not track him down.\\n\\nGraham and Sherry Edwards fly to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son\\'s description has been seen in a bar called Underground. The report comes to nothing.\\n\\nEdwards\\' sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance. \"I\\'d just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and we\\'d like him to come back - me, mum and dad,\" she said.\\n\\nThe band play a concert in the Cuban capital, Havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there.\\n\\nOn the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards\\' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. They refuse. The Big Issue magazine, which supports homelessness charities, prints the last known picture of Edwards in a fresh plea for information.\\n\\nA pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the River Severn have no link to Edwards, police say.\\n\\nThe last song written by Edwards - a song called Judge Y\\'Self, which was to have been used for the Judge Dredd film soundtrack - is released on the B-side compilation Lipstick Traces. A skeleton found by the River Severn is not Edwards, tests reveal.\\n\\nThe Manics\\' seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife.\\n\\nThe remaining Manic Street Preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band\\'s royalties into an account held in his name.',\n",

But it has not put him off. \"Of all the things I do in my life the most exciting thing I\\'ve ever done, and the thing I have most loved, is being part of a record company,\" he added.\\n\\n\"The idea of working with brilliant young musicians, and being close to the centre of popular culture, is just the biggest thrill in my life.\" Wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see Raw T, but he had initially been reluctant saying he \"detested\" young British people rapping. \"It\\'s always inauthentic, it\\'s always crass, it never really works for me,\" he said. \"I went to see this group, Raw T - which stands for Realise And Witness Talent - and like everyone else in the room that night, we were utterly blown away.\" Wilson believes Raw T could be \"to F4 as Joy Division were to Factory records\".\\n\\nThe story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan.\\n\\nWilson stressed that the independent music scene remained \"as important\" as it had been during the 1980s, when labels such as Factory and Rough Trade proliferated. He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - \"perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium\" - were signed to indies. \"I think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,\" he added. \"They can make more money that way - it\\'s a more generous relationship, and also it\\'s a more understanding relationship. \"I think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.\"',\n",

The campaign, which led to gigs being scrapped and a UK police investigation, will now be dropped under the truce. Brett Lock of gay group OutRage! said they were \"wiping the slate clean\". The protests had been led by the Stop Murder Music coalition, an umbrella group including OutRage!, the Black Gay Men\\'s Advisory Group and Jamaican movement J-Flag.\\n\\nThat coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scene\\'s biggest stars. But the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up. Instead, the record companies have pledged not to release or re-release any offensive songs - many of which date back a number of years. And it is believed promoters will make stars agree not to perform such tunes on stage. \"The reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom,\" according to media and PR strategist Glen Yearwood, who is representing the reggae industry.\\n\\nThe industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender, he said. \"We\\'ll advise them this is not the way forward in a civilised society.\" The Stop Murder Music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in Sizzla\\'s UK tour being cancelled in November, forced Mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw Beenie Man dropped from an MTV show in August. Police have also been investigating whether lyrics incite the assault and murder of gay people. The campaign was a blow to the reggae industry, Mr Yearwood admitted. \"If you can\\'t have major stars touring, then you don\\'t sell many albums,\" he said.\\n\\nBut the artists - Beenie Man, Sizzla, Elephant Man, Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, TOK, Capleton and Vybz Kartel - will not have to apologise for past songs or comments. OutRage!\\'s Mr Lock said: \"The main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there aren\\'t any violently homophobic or gay-bashing lyrics in the future. \"As a gesture of good faith, the Stop Murder Music coalition has agreed to suspend our aggressive campaigning against murder music. \"So we shall not be picketing concerts or calling for prosecutions to give the industry the space to regulate and reform itself.\" Record companies VP and Greensleeves, distributor Jet Star and concert promoters including Jammins and Apollo Entertainment are all on board.',\n",

Thank you all you guys for voting for me, I feel sick right now.\" Viewers of digital music TV channel MTV Base voted Stone the winner in the best urban act category.\\n\\nLittle Britain comedy duo Matt Lucas and David Walliams presented the best song prize to Robbie Williams dressed as his former Take That colleagues Gary Barlow and Howard Donald, leading him to quip he was \"always the talented man of the band\".\\n\\nWilliams\\' track beat songs by Will Young, Queen, Kate Bush and Joy Division in a vote by BBC Radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the UK music industry ceremony. It is his 15th Brit award, having already received 10 solo awards and four with Take That. He told the audience: \"I\\'m just amazed that my career keeps going.\" Keane frontman Tom Chaplin thanked fans for enduring \"rubbish gigs\" after they won the British breakthrough act prize. He added: \"A lot of people don\\'t think it\\'s cool that we\\'ve had the guts to be ourselves but it\\'s a vital part of who we are as a band and receiving this is recognition of that.\"\\n\\nNatasha Bedingfield - in the running for best British female and best pop act - performed with her brother Daniel for the first time at Wednesday\\'s event.\\n\\nThe chart-topping siblings duetted on the Chaka Khan hit Ain\\'t Nobody. Meanwhile, Joss Stone performed Right To Be Wrong backed by a gospel choir, while Lemar and Jamelia performed the Robert Palmer track Addicted To Love. Bob Geldof won a prize for his outstanding contribution to music. Of the 15 Brit awards for achievements in 2004, 10 were won by artists tipped in the BBC News website\\'s Sound of 2004 list of artists to watch, published at the start of last year. Scissor Sisters, Franz Ferdinand, Keane, Joss Stone and McFly were all in the Sound of 2004 top 10. The other five Brits winners were already established before Sound of 2004 was compiled. The ceremony will be televised on ITV1 on Thursday.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m speechless. Best song of the last 25 years? Yeah right.\\n\\nI very much doubt that \\'Angels\\' was even the best song of the week that it came out. Like every track Robbie has released as a single, it\\'s a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before.\\n\\nGive us a break...!!!\\n\\nBest song in 25 years, you must be joking. Its good if you like that sort of thing, but really!\\n\\nListened to Angels on Radio 1 this morning when I was driving into work. Had not heard it for a while. I love Robs voice, the lyrics and tune. Perfection!\\n\\nAs usual, the public have short memories when it comes to voting for \"the greatest\". There must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more. It\\'s not exactly groundbreaking. Presumably, the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low...\\n\\nI\\'m actually embarrassed to be British if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!\\n\\nWhat about The Specials - Ghost Town, The Buzzcocks - Ever Fallen in Love With Someone... Happy Mondays - Kinky Afro, McAlmont & Butler - Yes, Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart... Angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish.\\n\\nAngels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. It\\'s musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated, a bit like Mr Williams himself. This result isn\\'t very surprising though, The Brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music!\\n\\nBest of the last 25 years? Maybe. Cunning to make the timescale not include Stairway to Heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody, but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. Not much competition in the last 25 years after all.\\n\\nIt\\'s alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???\\n\\nThere is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it\\'s a travesty.\\n\\nRubbish! Who voted it for it to be included in any list? I am a regular listener to Radio 2 but I don\\'t recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn\\'t know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly NOT the best song of the last 25 years. How depressing and just when we thought manufactured \\'pop\\' was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from?\\n\\nWhile I am biassed in that I thought Love Will Tear Us Apart should have won, in all seriousness, I think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. Then again, well done Robbie, good show.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got to be kidding.\\n\\nAngels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years. Only the best song to be up for nomination at the Brits.\\n\\nI think Angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but I don\\'t think its the best song from the past 25 years! Right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was Will Young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn\\'t that good! I\\'m happy for Robbie himself though!\\n\\nBest song in the last 25 years? What a Joke! Think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than Angels. Phil Collins doesn\\'t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote? Angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. Soppy rubbish at best. Hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon, and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards.\\n\\nSo boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in Britain today, for me it\\'s proof that music and democracy just don\\'t mix. Still, at least it wasn\\'t Will Young...\\n\\nOh it\\'s all just a bit of fun. People take these awards too seriously! Robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels. Him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. Personally I wanted Will Young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent!\\n\\nI hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with!\\n\\nI agree about Angels. I never get fed up hearing it. Whenever the song comes on the radio I turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). The song makes me calm and serene and happy. Well done Robbie.\\n\\nI think that although Robbie Williams is a good performer, that Angels isn\\'t really that good a song. It certainly isn\\'t anywhere near as good as Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division or Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush.\\n\\nAngels is a fantastic song. All credit to Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. It\\'s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.\\n\\nRobbie did in no way deserve that mantle. Whenever we have these awards it is always \\'artists\\' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...We forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. They weren\\'t cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.\\n\\nYes Angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.\\n\\nI\\'ve always disliked Angels intensely. I believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of British pre-teens, teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as \"classic\" songwriting. It\\'s \\'orrible. It seems obvious to me that people who like Robbie are people who don\\'t particularly like music all that much. Folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. Angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer\\'s afternoon picnic. What a dreadful result. If you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don\\'t you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. Booo hisss\\n\\nAngels, best song? You are kidding, right? Last five years I might be willing to accept, but 25, no way. Did whoever voted for this actually have ANY music knowledge prior to, say, 1995? Really quite insulting to the British music industry of the past quarter of a century.\\n\\nNo surprise about Robbie Williams considering the list. Where on earth did the nominations list come from???? Compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps?? I mean, Will Young? Come on.\\n\\nWhat a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - I don\\'t think so!! What about all the REAL artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but Robbie Williams doesn\\'t even come close.\\n\\nWhat a joke. That song has become such a bane to me that I have developed a Pavlovian response to the word \\'Angels\\' where I thrash around, and scream \"no no no no no\" until someone tells me \"the radio\\'s off\". Why a half-baked cheesy ditty like Angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on Pop Idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me. If this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.\\n\\nWhy do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country?? The initial list was very weak anyway, but Angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! I think not, I didn\\'t realize Radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!!\\n\\nPeople have such short memories! A great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years? Not a chance. I think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.\\n\\nThe Great British Public at work again. It\\'s a mediocre, sentimental and safe song. Granted, it\\'s not too bad, either. But can it stand up against ANYTHING by The Smiths (in particular \"How Soon is Now?\") or anything from the Stone Roses\\' first album? Nope.\\n\\nNo, Because I\\'m not female and I\\'m not 10!\\n\\nOk I like Robbie and Angels is a decent song. But it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! The shortlist wasn\\'t great but him winning it is a joke!\\n\\nPredictable and laughable.\\n\\nThe success of Angels at this years Brits reflects poorly on the state of British music over the last 25 years. The British public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. Whilst Angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in Robbie\\'s repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.\\n\\nI am a huge Robbie fan and love that song. But I think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.\\n\\nHave Radio 2 listeners even heard of Joy Division? A band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than Robbie Williams ever will.\\n\\nNo doubt about it. There\\'s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. Some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but Angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.\\n\\nIt should have been Joy Division.Those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while Angels remains yet another pop song. I sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that Robbie Williams inspired their art in the way that the Byrds, the Beatles and Nick Drake have done for music today.\\n\\nYes!! I think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. There were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! Robbie was a deserved winner.\\n\\nI am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it\\'s a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don\\'t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.\\n\\nThe best song of the past 25 years? Really? Come on, this is surely a joke? No? I think I need a long lie down...\\n\\nIt just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick Robbie Williams over the beautifully talented Kate Bush and Joy Division. I suppose it\\'s confirmed one thing - the British public are consistently dull :- &lt;(\\n\\nNo offence Robbie, but pleeease! There must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. No one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of British music, and a further nail in the coffin!\\n\\nI think Robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in Britain since John Lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. Anybody who says he doesn\\'t deserve it is jealous of his success. The only real challenger was Queen but hey, Another One Bites the Dust!!\\n\\nObviously all the Karaoke singers in the UK voted for it.\\n\\nIf this is the best song of the last 25 years then the British Music industry is in trouble. Sure Robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.\\n\\nA sad day for music\\n\\nIt\\'s not the type of music I normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, I recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. That\\'s why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. It\\'s a good all-rounder. Just like Robbie.\\n\\nBest song in 25 years? Since 1980? I\\'m confused. \"Angels\" isn\\'t a bad song. It\\'s a nice, catchy, formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. But this is not great music. If anything it\\'s regressive. Bland even. I suppose it\\'s just more evidence of how redundant the Brit Awards have become.\\n\\nGranted angels is a good song, however it really wasn\\'t up against any other proper competition. The Queen\\'s song was lackluster, and apart from Kate Bush, the other choices were pathetic! Also, why weren\\'t the Stones there, David Bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than Angels...I wonder if it was simply the fact that Robbie wasn\\'t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!\\n\\nBest song of the last 25 years? What a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner. Sigh. On the upside, at least it wasn\\'t Bohemian Rhapsody, for which we should all be thankful.\\n\\nAngels is without doubt a great song but I really don\\'t think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on Robbies\\' goodlooks than the actual song!!! Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners.\\n\\nIt would have been a travesty had Angels not won. Without Angels, Robbie Williams may well not be where he is now, and Britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. It has to be seen performed live, with 125,000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. Well done Rob.\\n\\nI find it hard to believe that \\'Angels\\' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! I\\'m rapidly redifining \\'best\\' in my own head now to mean \\'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning\\'. What about Britpop? Blur, Oasis, Suede, Pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes, doing something different. Why must \\'best\\' always come down to most commercially popular?\\n\\nI\\'ve nothing against Robbie, I actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year? The Brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. The same goes with the Scissor Sisters, I think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near U2\\'s new record, neither are they in the same league. Once again there have been some baffling discisions made, they are not for artisic reasons, but for profit.\\n\\nNo surprise really, it\\'s voted for by the general public. Since when did they have taste in music?\\n\\nPersonally I find Angels by Robbie Williams to be one of the most irritating songs I have ever heard!\\n\\nIt absolutely deserved to win. It is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.\\n\\nIt\\'s an absolute joke, however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. All in all a pretty pointless exercise !\\n\\nThe song is overplayed and oversentimental. Out of the rather poor five choices that were left, it should have gone to either Joy Division or Queen. I suppose we should be thankful that it didn\\'t end up in the hands of Will Young though.\\n\\nAlthough it has nostalgia value, there is no way it deserved to win. Everybody knows the words to Bohemian Rhapsody, Nothing Compares 2 U, etc. Much better songs and more timeless. Give it to someone with real talent.\\n\\nAlthough Angels is a good song I think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. This is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. Why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that\\'s all it means!',\n",

She released four number ones from her 2000 album Drama, including the top five hit Money featuring the vocals of reggae artist Beenie Man. She racked up five Mobo nominations in 2000, winning one for best video. But in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter Teja, who was born in March 2001. While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single. During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself. Her comeback song Bout featuring Rah Digga only just scrapped into the top 40.\\n\\nIt was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain\\'s most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.\\n\\nSuperstar was followed by Thank You, winner of best single at the 2004 Mobos, which reached number two in the UK charts. The autobiographical song, which deals with domestic abuse, hit number one in New Zealand and Australia. Next came the song See It In A Boy\\'s Eyes, which was especially written for her by Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin. His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B. She now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the NSPCC and Make Trade Fair. Despite her huge success in recent years, Jamelia remains down-to-earth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business, partly due to motherhood. \"When I first got into the industry, I\\'d be away from home for months at a time. But now I have other things in my life. I still want to make it, but it\\'s not the end of the world if I don\\'t,\" commented Jamelia.',\n",

They have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic, in contrast to fellow Brit nominees such as Keane and Snow Patrol. \"British music needs a kick up the arse and Britain needs a new band to breathe life into the British people again,\" declared Kasabian\\'s singer Tom Meighan.\\n\\n\"No-one\\'s doing it at the minute. Music feels like it\\'s in the afterlife right now. We don\\'t want people to give up on it. \"The serpent\\'s going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away!\" Meighan grew up in Leicester with Kasabian songwriter/guitarist Sergio Pizzorno and bassist Chris Edwards, a trio which began making music from the age of 17.\\n\\nThey enlisted guitarist and keyboard player Christopher Karloff after spotting him in a pub. \"We saw his long sideburns and thought \\'hey, he looks the part, we\\'ll ask him,\\'\" said Meighan. Inspired by Britpop and a mutual love of hardcore, an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility, they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound. \"We got a computer and we cut rock\\'n\\'roll up, because there\\'s no point in going back to how it was,\" said Meighan. \"It\\'s all about new ideas and creativity.\"\\n\\nThe band\\'s original approach is reflected in its name, inspired by Linda Kasabian - the getaway driver of US serial killer Charles Manson. Coincidentally it is also the Armenian term for \"butcher\". Kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in Rutland to record their debut album, benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there. Signed to the RCA record label, Kasabian tested the water with two singles, Club Foot and LSF, which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the UK singles chart respectively.\\n\\nThey built up their following on the summer festival circuit, opening both Glastonbury and T in the Park, and at a series of \"guerilla gigs\" at unusual venues including Half Time Orange, a pub next to Leicester City football club\\'s headquarters. Kasabian\\'s self-titled album was released last September to widespread critical acclaim, its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to The Stone Roses, Primal Scream and The Happy Mondays.\\n\\nRegarding it as \"both a fiery assertion of rock \\'n\\' roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of Rutland Water\", the NME\\'s praise was typical of the album\\'s reception. As 2004 progressed Kasabian would score a further two hits - Processed Beats and Cutt Off - and embark upon a well-received UK tour. \"We take our music seriously, definitely, but we want to have fun with it,\" said Pizzorno. \"This is not a job to us,\" added Meighan. \"This is the best life we could ever have. This is what it\\'s all about and without it we\\'d be lost souls. But music needs us as well.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Brits debate over \\'urban\\' music\\n\\nJoss Stone, a 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, beat Dizzee Rascal, Jamelia, Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards. Her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not really comfortable with the word urban. It\\'s a word that\\'s been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music. The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it\\'s wrong. How far are the Brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing? It\\'s so far removed that I don\\'t expect them to get it bang on. The music industry isn\\'t championing music from our particular genre very well anyway. People don\\'t feel like that\\'s anything to do with us. I don\\'t feel like urban music\\'s just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that there\\'s an urban music scene because it\\'s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. It\\'s not really relevant. If Joss Stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she\\'s signed to, then so be it. It\\'s got nothing to do with what\\'s really going on.\\n\\n\\n\\nUrban as a genre is very broad. If you look underneath urban, there are a number of core elements that include hip-hop, R&B, garage and into that obviously comes soul. Joss Stone is a soul artist. Her first album was called The Soul Sessions. So urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres, and there are offshoots of all of those. Joss Stone has had amazing success [in the US] given that she\\'s a UK artist. What has really captured everybody\\'s imagination is that here you have a 17-year-old from Devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really, really good tunes and she looks good - I think that\\'s what\\'s done it.\\n\\nThe award for best British urban act was voted for by viewers of MTV Base.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think Joss was not a worthy winner. She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban. The fact that she\\'s from Devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she\\'s literally rural. The great thing about urban music is that there\\'s a big range. If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think that\\'s where you can call it urban - that\\'s where this new sub-category, or uber-category, has come from. Joss Stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer, but you couldn\\'t argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions - it is coming from somewhere genuine. It has to come across as real. That\\'s the only cut-off point we have here and that\\'s the only way by which we judge people.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background. Music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi-cultural Britain, then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion. If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. Race doesn\\'t make a difference if everyone is included. Out of all the awards dished out yesterday, I\\'m still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award.\\n\\n\\n\\nA type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.\\n\\nShe might not be urban, but when did R&B become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? R&B stands for Rhythm And Blues, remember!\\n\\nThat Joss Stone is rubbish is certain. If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (I think probably should include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim\\n\\nShe definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone\\'s albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year. This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren\\'t nominated or didn\\'t win. I cant see why people can\\'t just congratulate her for the talent that she is.\\n\\nShe did deserve it, but I agree with the comments about urban music. Its a stupid phrase, and particularly British. In the states they tend to use hip hop and R&B, if I say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what I\\'m talking about. Very strange.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in a name? A rose by any other name etc... If people want to call it urban, why not? If we really analysed it, the term \\'dance music\\' is misleading because it doesn\\'t describe everything you can dance to.\\n\\nWhilst I agree that the term \\'urban\\' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won. \\'Urban\\' to me is what I hear being played in parties in the inner cities - I live in Brixton and have never heard The Soul Sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties I\\'ve been to. Good luck to Joss Stone, let\\'s celebrate her victory - let\\'s also question why, with artists so successful and talented as Jamelia, Lemar, Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Alicia Keys and Outkast - we didn\\'t see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.\\n\\nSo, what you\\'re saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn\\'t black. And, if it is, then they shouldn\\'t be acknowledged for it even if they\\'re pretty dam good at it? She\\'s 17, has an amazing voice, and won. Good on her. Oh, but she\\'s not \"black\" well, let\\'s make her feel real bad about it then. How dare she! Though hang on, didn\\'t the so-called \\'public\\' vote on this one?\\n\\nThis idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what \"Jazz\" was. The media then called anything that had a swinging beat, syncopated melody or soulful feeling \"Jazz\", much to the chagrin of the artists. It would mean that \"blues\" would be put in the same mould as \"bebop\", \"cool\" and \"ragtime\", all very different styles at that time. Jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term. And so what of \"Urban\" music? In truth it\\'s a lazy term to categorise music that you don\\'t really understand. Soul and garage are worlds apart musically (Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam?), but no doubt have their connections. If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.\\n\\nI demand a prize for rural music! Sucks to the cities- it\\'s way better out here. We have hay, for one thing.\\n\\nExcluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely? I dont understand the point that Ty is making. If Lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than Joss\\' work won, he might have said nothing. (btw i\\'m black too)\\n\\nHow can she be \"urban\" if she spent most of her life in the Devon countryside? Nonsense.\\n\\nI love Joss to bits and don\\'t care what her branding is - it\\'s amazing music, full stop. Stop puting it all in brackets and let\\'s just call it music, and let\\'s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.\\n\\nSurely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from. Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music. If that person was good at it and authentic in sound, would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style?\\n\\nThe term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards. The very term \\'Music of Black Origin\\' has confused and offended many people. This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards. It appears that the use of \\'black\\' or \\'white\\' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable. The term \\'urban\\' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first \\'black\\' or \\'white\\' thereby rendering the issue colourblind. The result is now a redundant new debate as to what \\'urban\\' also means. Perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/RnB and Hip-Hop, one which does not also mean something else - as we have done with \\'Crunk\\'.\\n\\nUrban is just a word that\\'s come about recently to describe \"black\" music that\\'s become popular now. The word wasn\\'t even in use, or common use five of six years ago. It\\'s just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it.\\n\\nI\\'m in a band that has been called \"urban\", and I despise the label. I\\'d hate to think I belonged to any neat marketing niche, because that\\'s all it is. Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider \\'music of black origin\\', these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity. Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some \\'urban\\' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music. Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.\\n\\nAs a black man, I think I agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives. Black people should lead the music they invented . We should stop calling a genre meaningless, northing is meaningless. The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? Same thing, with Streets, Amy Winehouse, etc. Who\\'s ever heard of Terri Walker or Rhian Benson.. They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos , but why not Brits????\\n\\nSo what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards. Her music is great soul and surely that is under the \\'Urban\\' banner? What if The Streets had won? Would people be whining because Mike Skinner is white... It seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else.\\n\\nUrban is PC version for saying black music. I\\'m not doubting Ms Stone\\'s talent, but why didn\\'t Jamelia or Lemar get a Brit? This reminds me of what happened to Craig David and Soul II Soul in the past, getting nominations are easy to get, but picking up a Brit seems to be the hardest thing.\\n\\nRefreshing to see people making reasonable, intelligent comments on any topic these days. More power to you, people! You have said it: there is music you like and music you don\\'t like - who cares what label you put on it?\\n\\nThat entire category was a mess. How can you have people like Dizzee Rascal up against Joss Stone? Its like putting Eminem against Bob Geldof. She should have been nominated for Best British R & B act. Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don\\'t think it was very \\'urban\\' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.\\n\\nUrban is a nonsense term - music of black origin? Well doesn\\'t that include rock? Music made in the inner cities? Well almost all bands end up making music in London/Manchester etc. And doesn\\'t that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? It doesn\\'t make any sense.\\n\\nWhy does music have to be put into a genre? It\\'s music, you like it or you don\\'t. Simple as that.\\n\\nI play in a heavy metal band. We are urban music as far as I\\'m concerned. We live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; It therefore directly shapes what we write musically.\\n\\n\"Urban\" seems to be the new name for all styles of black music. Why it needed a rebrand I don\\'t know as the name is misleading. Oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know, therefore more than fit the term \"urban\" yet as they\\'re a white rock band they won\\'t be described as such.\\n\\nJoss Stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the Brit? All this \"urban\" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.\\n\\nYeah, she deserved it. She is talented. Urban is a crap, meaningless, politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though. There\\'s only two kinds of music: good and bad.',\n",

Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist. \"The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrix\\'s house,\" said Ray Rae Marshall of the James Marshall Hendrix Foundation. The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002. Now the City of Seattle wants its new plot to be used for development, giving a deadline of 22 February for the home to be moved.

Seattle officials said no such deal had been offered.\\n\\n\"We never said, \\'You can own this property,\\'\" said John Franklin, chief of its operations department. \"From our perspective, it was a temporary situation.

In the second, Ms Love, 40, pleaded guilty to possessing a forged prescription and painkiller oxycodone. She must also do 100 hours community service, have drug treatment, attend Narcotics Anonymous and pay a fine. The ex-Hole singer\\'s lawyer Howard Weitzman said Ms Love had \"turned her life around\" and she was \"clean and sober\".\\n\\nThe assault charge stemmed from April 2004, when Ms Love found musician Kristin King in her boyfriend\\'s home. Ms King said the singer \"threw the bottle at the left side of my face\" in an \"angry, vicious and erratic\" attack. Ms Love was originally charged with the more serious offence of assault with a deadly weapon, but that was reduced to assault. Judge Rand Rubin said she must:\\n\\n- Spend three years on probation \\n - Have one year\\'s anger management counselling \\n - Have one year\\'s drug rehabilitation \\n - Do 100 hours community service \\n - Pay $1,000 (£535) fine \\n - Have random drug tests \\n - Go to three Narcotics Anonymous meetings per week\\n\\nIn the drugs case, she was sentenced to 18 months probation, to run concurrently with the probation for the assault. That offence stemmed from October 2003, when she suffered an overdose after breaking a window at her boyfriend\\'s home. In a separate case relating to the same incident, Ms Love was sentenced to 18 months in drug rehabilitation for being under the influence of cocaine and opiates. In another case last October, she pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for hitting a man on the head with a microphone stand at a New York City nightclub. Last month her lawyers said she had won back custody of Frances Bean, her 12-year-old daughter with former Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. The girl was removed from her care following her double arrest in October 2003. Cobain committed suicide in 1994.',\n",

But his solo career almost ended before it began after a near-fatal car crash left West with his jaw wired shut in 2002. The resulting song, Through the Wire, became West\\'s first UK hit in April 2004 and subsequent album The College Dropout became a transatlantic success, both critically and commercially. West, 26, began rapping as a teenager at his Chicago school, inspired by the beats and rhymes of 1980s pioneers Run DMC.\\n\\nHip-hop producer No ID encouraged West to sample old soul and R&B hits then revive them with an updated sound, an approach that would become his trademark. \"I feel like a lot of the soul that\\'s in those old records that I sample is in me,\" he said. \"So when I hear them and I put them with the drums and I bring them to the new millennium, it\\'s just like God\\'s doing that. I\\'m one with them records right there. It\\'s a blessing.\"\\n\\nLeaving his Chicago art school after only one year - a move which would later inspire the title of his album - West began his music career co-producing songs for artists Mase and the Madd Rapper. This drew the attention of superstar rapper Jay-Z, who signed West up to his Roc-A-Fella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster. West\\'s work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles Takeover and Izzo (HOVA) on Jay-Z\\'s own 2001 album Blueprint. Incorporating samples of Five to One by The Doors and the Jackson Five\\'s I Want You Back respectively, the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hip-hop.\\n\\nAs their success attracted further production work for Jay-Z (\\'03 Bonnie & Clyde) and artists such as Ludacris (Stand Up) and Alicia Keys (You Don\\'t Know My Name), West announced plans for a solo album. Driving home from a late-night Los Angeles recording session in October 2002, he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places. \"Anytime I hear about any accident my heart sinks in and I just thank God that I\\'m still here,\" he later said. \"That steering wheel could have been two inches further out, and that would have been it.\"\\n\\nWest\\'s account of the accident sampled Chaka Khan\\'s hit Through the Fire to become the heart of his completed solo album The College Dropout. Released last year, it was by turns smooth, humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clich&#233;d hip-hop preoccupation with guns, girls and jewellery.\\n\\nThrough the Wire was quickly joined in the UK and US charts by Slow Jamz, on which West collaborated with rapper Twista and Ray actor Jamie Foxx. The College Dropout spawned two further UK hits and a string of award nominations. West was shortlisted for 10 Grammys - including nominations for artist and album of the year - and took the best hip-hop artist, producer and album titles at last year\\'s Music of Black Origin (Mobo) Awards. Now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hip-hop, Kanye West is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early.',\n",

The music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive, if not always groundbreaking. But such success is down to more than music. They have to be compelling performers, charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. They also have to want it. They have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. The Beatles had it, the Rolling Stones still have it, REM hold onto it and Queen were it in a catsuit. And U2 have it in spades, and keep churning it out. Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in Dublin and 17 years after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list.\\n\\nThey may have lost some of the edginess and raw, youthful force that propelled them to the top, but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums.\\n\\nVertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK singles chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit. \"The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,\" Bono recently said. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr echoed those sentiments: \"We\\'re very competitive - we want to be on the radio, have big singles. We don\\'t want to be thought of as a veteran band.\" The band have done \"everything in their considerable powers\" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to Q magazine editor Paul Rees.\\n\\n\"This makes them hugely determined and formidable.\" He added: \"They are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up. \"As such, they\\'ve constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. They are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.\" The other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised, Mr Rees said. \"They do everything in the right way.\" The group were born when Mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board, attracting fellow pupils Paul Hewson (Bono, vocals), Adam Clayton (bass), David Evans (The Edge, guitar) and his brother Dick.\\n\\nDick Evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as The Feedback and The Hype before settling on U2.\\n\\nBy 1978, they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager, Paul McGuinness. \"They were brilliant, but very coarse,\" McGuinness recently said. \"In a way, they were doing exactly what they do now. Only badly.\" They struggled to attract record company attention, later being described as \"pretty damn average\" and \"strange and eerie\" by scouts who saw them live. They released two Ireland-only singles, which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980, leading to a deal with Island and their debut album Boy. The stadium-filling, anthemic sound was U2\\'s aim from the start, and their third album, War, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US. Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year\\'s Day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected as a cliche.\\n\\nHis stage performances - which included flag-waving, speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer, and their appearance at 1985\\'s Live Aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom.\\n\\nIn 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven\\'t Found What I\\'m Looking For and With Or Without You. Those songs took the band\\'s epic, atmospheric sound to a simple, powerful and popular pinnacle. The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. These came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal. The Achtung Baby album in 1991 was followed by Zooropa, Pop and their corresponding stadium tours, which featured giant olives, flying cars, live phone calls to the White House and Bono\\'s transformation into alter-egos The Fly and MacPhisto. He was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to Aids. Before the release of How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world. But they still want more.',\n",

His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil\\'s\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\\n\\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock \\'n\\' roll greats, including I\\'ve Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What\\'d I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael\\'s sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\\n\\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson\\'s I Can\\'t Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\\n\\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said.

R&B star Keys won four awards herself at the Grammy ceremony in Los Angeles. U2, Usher, Norah Jones and Kanye West got three each. West led the race going into the ceremony with 10 nominations.\\n\\nCharles\\' last album, Genius Loves Company, a collection of duets that has sold more than two million copies, was named album of the year and best pop vocal album. His song Here We Go Again with Norah Jones won record of the year and best pop vocal collaboration, while Heaven Help Us All with Gladys Knight picked up best gospel performance. Jones said: \"I\\'m glad he\\'s getting recognised, because of who he is and how much I love him.\" Actor Jamie Foxx - who is nominated for an Oscar for playing Charles in the hit movie Ray - dedicated a rendition of Georgia on My Mind to \"old friends\". Keys, looking to replicate her Grammys success of 2002, when she won five, picked up best R&B song for You Don\\'t Know My Name and best R&B album for The Diary of Alicia Keys. She also shared the award for best R&B vocal performance by a duo or group with Usher for My Boo.\\n\\nUsher\\'s other victories were for best contemporary R&B album for Confessions and best rap/sung collaboration for Yeah!, featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris. Kanye West dominated the rap categories, winning best rap song for Jesus Walks and best rap album for The College Dropout. But in one of the night\\'s biggest shocks, he lost out in the battle to be named best new artist to pop rock act Maroon 5. Vertigo by rock giants U2 won three trophies - best rock song, best short video and best rock vocal performance by a duo or group. One of the other main awards, song of the year, went to US singer-songwriter John Mayer for Daughters. Mayer also won best male pop vocal performance. Britney Spears picked up her first ever Grammy for her song Toxic, which was named best dance recording.\\n\\nRod Stewart also won the first Grammy of his career, getting the best traditional pop album award for Stardust... The Great American Songbook: Volume III. In 2003, Stewart said he was \"astounded\" he had never won a Grammy - but \"they tend not to give it to the British unless you\\'re Sting\". There were few other high-profile British victors this year. Annie Lennox, metal group Motorhead and dance act Basement Jaxx all took home trophies. But Elvis Costello, who had four nominations, and Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand, who were both up for three awards, got nothing.\\n\\nBeach Boys veteran Brian Wilson was another first-time winner - for best rock instrumental performance. \"It represents triumph and achievement in music that I feel that I deserved, and I\\'m really glad I won,\" he said. A live recording of composer John Adams\\' 11 September tribute, On the Transmigration of Souls, performed by the New York Philharmonic, won three classical prizes. And former US President Bill Clinton picked up the second Grammy of his career, winning the spoken word award for the audio version of his autobiography My Life.',\n",

Faltskog has been a virtual recluse since the band split up in 1982. The musical, which has become a global phenomenon, will be performed in Swedish for the first time. Fans camped outside Stockholm's Cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars. The premiere marks Abba's first public reunion since the legendary band's acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s. It was thought that Faltskog would appear in London for the musical's fifth anniversary celebrations in April 2004 but she stayed away due to her fear of flying.\\n\\nOriginal Abba member Bjorn Ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band's mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming, alongside Swedish artist Niklas Stromstedt. Almost all of Abba's original songs, which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide, were written and recorded in English. The musical, set on a small Greek island, tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother. The show will include such classics as Super Trouper, SOS and Dancing Queen. There are currently 14 productions being staged worldwide, including New York and London, with road shows in Toronto, South Korea and Madrid. More than 20 million people around the world have seen the show.\",\n",

The band have three more efforts on the list, including fifth-placed Paranoid. Osbourne appears more than any other act, with two solo records featured. The top five includes Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden and Sex Pistols. Queen, Muse, Manic Street Preachers and The Clash complete the top 10.

Motorhead, Judas Priest and Prodigy are included along with newer acts like The Darkness and Lostprophets.\\n\\nKerrang! editor Ashley Bird said: \"It\\'s amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list, and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene. \"These are the real opinions of proper rock fans.\"\\n\\nFormed by four teenage friends in the West Midlands in the late 1960s, Black Sabbath are one of Britain\\'s most successful heavy rock bands. Their debut was a UK top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the US. Osbourne said the band\\'s success in the Kerrang! poll was a triumph for British rock. He said: \"Back then you\\'d hear: \\'If you go to San Francisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair\\'. \"We lived in Aston, Birmingham. The only flowers I ever saw were on a gravestone in our local cemetery.\" Despite being disliked by many critics, Black Sabbath\\'s subsequent albums included multi-million sellers but internal rows led to Osbourne leaving in 1979. The band continued without Osbourne, who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide. He was eventually cleared of the charges. Osbourne, who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982, rejoined the band to play the Live Aid charity concert in 1985. After many changes in line-up, the original four members reunited to play live dates in 1997.

Renner warned that unless the industry accepted \"new realties\" - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible. \"The problem the music industry has got is that they aren\\'t willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,\" he stated. \"So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie.\"\\n\\nThe music market in Germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (£1.8bn). Since 2000, sales have plummeted to just 1.6bn euros (£1.1bn) in 2003. In the space of one year - between 2002 and 2003 - CD album sales fell by 13.8%. But a study by the Society for Consumer Research found that at the same time, more than twice as many recordable CDs had music recorded on them than CD albums were sold. Mr Renner pointed out that, because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this was particularly damaging.\\n\\n\"You need time,\" he added. However, Peter Zombic, the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany, said he did not feel the situation was as \"dramatic\" as Mr Renner believed. \"It\\'s quite true that we have severe problems in Germany - but that\\'s true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too,\" he argued. \"We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. \"I don\\'t agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful.\" He did, however, admit that copyright owners have \"partly lost control of their copyright\", due to piracy and copying.\\n\\nBut he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. \"We were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,\" he argued. \"At that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the Napster time, when P2P services became popular. \"It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned.\" Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem. German law does allow people to make copies of CDs for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright. Mr Zombic said that this legal framework was a \"huge problem\". \"There is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby, it\\'s nice, it\\'s fun,\" he added. \"We try to make clear it\\'s not nice and it\\'s not fun - it\\'s endangering the creativity in our country.\"',\n",

But all eyes were on the musical prizes after The Producers, Mary Poppins and The Woman in White all had high-profile openings in the last six months.\\n\\nThe Producers' Nathan Lane, a last-minute replacement for Richard Dreyfuss, beat his former co-star Lee Evans to win best musical actor. Lane has already left the production. A smash hit on Broadway before moving to London, the show also won best musical performance in a supporting role for Conleth Hill, who plays director Roger DeBris. Mary Poppins' awards came for best choreography and best musical actress for its star Laura Michelle Kelly. It led the nominations going into Sunday's ceremony at London's Hilton hotel, up for nine awards. Both shows are stage adaptations of 1960s films. The History Boys, set in a grammar school in the early 1980s and partly based on Bennett's experiences as a teacher, was named best new play.\\n\\nIt also won best actor for Richard Griffiths, who beat his Harry Potter film co-star Michael Gambon, nominated for Endgame, as well as Jonathan Pryce and Ben Whishaw. The play also won National Theatre artistic director Nicholas Hytner best director and Bennett got a special award for outstanding contribution to British theatre. Dame Judi Dench, who starred in All's Well That Ends Well at the Gielgud, lost out in the best supporting role category to Amanda Harris, who played Emilia in Othello for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\\n\\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines\\' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There\\'s a few people getting hurt down the front, you\\'ve got to move back.\"\\n\\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden\\'s guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.',\n",

Julie Andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the Rogers and Hammerstein classic set in the Alpine country. But despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time, it is barely known inside Austria.\\n\\nThe film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s. The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938.\\n\\nSensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical. Another source of irritation for Austrians is the song Edelweiss, which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers. The song was actually an invention by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of Austria, including yodelling, goat-herds and lederhosen. The production is being staged at a Viennese opera house, the Volksoper, beginning on Saturday. Maria, the novice nun who falls in love with Baron von Trapp, will be played by Austro-Australian actress and singer Sandra Pires.\",\n",

All the important people. \"I guess it\\'s just a television show but we always think it\\'s a bit more.\\' The orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average Oscars show. As well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show. But you don\\'t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it\\'s exciting,\" explains Conti. And much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed. \"We don\\'t know who the winners will be. So when they say, \\'the winner is\\', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately,\" adds Conti.\\n\\nThe orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show\\'s producers.\\n\\nThe decision to drown out or \\'kill\\' the offending star with music is relayed from the director\\'s box to the orchestra via Conti\\'s earpiece. \"I don\\'t feel good about it at all. It\\'s not my call though,\" he says. \"When the director says \\'music\\' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. We don\\'t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off. \"The person that\\'s been cut off, who\\'s 10 feet from me, is glaring at me like it\\'s death time.\" On occasions, some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak. \"Julia Roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do,\" he says. Conti received an Oscar in 1983 for the original score of The Right Stuff. He also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for Gonna Fly Now from Rocky and in 1981 for the title song from For Your Eyes Only.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a moment in the sun,\" he says. \"When people get up there, some people, this is hard to believe, people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining, might get a little flustered. \"But there\\'s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they\\'re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.\"\\n\\nThe image of the Oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. Behind the scenes, the key players, such as Conti, have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. \"There\\'s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. I can control hearing in my ears, the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.\\n\\n\"I have to communicate with the director. I have a little microphone that\\'s attached to my headset. To open up that microphone, I have a footswitch,\" he explains. Conti\\'s most nerve-wracking moment came during his first Oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. Conti immediately told the show\\'s director: \"I start cursing and screaming, I tell him we\\'re not going to die for this show - you must do something or I\\'m going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we\\'re going to be home in 10 minutes. \"\\'Oh no Bill don\\'t do anything,\" came the response. \"Imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra, 60 or so of them in the pit and while we\\'re playing, firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke.\" The smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. \"No one died, it\\'s not a big story, but it was scary at the time,\" laughs Conti. When the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual Governor\\'s Ball with his family. \"I have a drink and relive the show,\" he says. \"I\\'m not for too much carousing. I go home and unwind. It takes me about a day.\"',\n",

Not that I ever did that. \"But things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change.\"\\n\\nThat change involved ejecting previous host Wes Butters and relocating King and DJ partner Joel Ross from their weekend afternoon Radio 1 slot. The pair have worked together for a decade - meeting on Viking Radio in Hull before moving to Manchester station Key 103 and winning two Sony Radio awards. They also presented gadget series Playboyz and car show Motor Maniacs for cable TV channel Granada Men and Motors, and Pure Soap on BBC Three.\\n\\nOn the revamped chart show their cheeky, laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions, film and DVD charts plus a look at future single releases, in addition to the singles chart itself. \"The chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme,\" says Ross. \"The show used to be the only way to discover who was in the Top 40. Now you can just click on the internet to find that out, so the show has plenty of extra items too.\" The show\\'s reduced reliance upon the Top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc, vinyl or cassette.\\n\\n\"I personally buy downloads rather than CD singles,\" says 27-year-old Ross. \"Even my grandma can download songs now. JK is still struggling with the technology, though.\" \"But it\\'s premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead,\" Ross adds. \"While sales of singles on traditional formats are down, interest in songs has been revived by download sales, which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from April. \"Music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week.\"\\n\\nRoss will be plumping for chart success from rapper Verbalicious and the Stereophonics on Sunday, while King is more of an R&B and dance music fan. \"So listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes,\" says King, 30, who describes outgoing host Butters as \"an extremely professional and competent broadcaster\".\\n\\n\"The advantage Joel and I have is that we\\'re a double act, with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive,\" King says. \"Wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him. And if not, I could always use a cleaner,\" he jokes. Ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show. \"Other people can worry about that, we are going to continue doing what we do well,\" he says. \"At the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining.

It is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school.

The film even has a song composed in English by AR Rahman, the director of the popular West End musical, Bombay Dreams. \"Identification is a popular cinematic device. Use of European or American actors can be viewed as a step in that direction,\" says Adarsh.\\n\\nThe cast of Kisna also includes British actors Michael Maloney, Caroline Langrishe and Polly Adams.\\n\\nAnother actress, Annabelle Wallace, plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy Dil Jo Bhi Kahey (Whatever the Heart Says), which also stars Indian screen legend Amitabh Bachchan.

It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.\\n\\nLast year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK. Several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and Miramax Films. Shooting on period drama Tulip Fever, which was to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of The Libertine starring Johnny Depp was moved to the Isle of Man.\\n\\n\"There isn\\'t anything coming in to replace (the funds),\" said The Libertine\\'s executive producer Marc Samuelson. \"We are in a hiatus.\" Films with \"medium\" budgets of up to £9m, a similar level to box office hits Vera Drake, Calendar Girls and Enduring Love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. Big budget co-productions, such as the Harry Potter series, continued to be shot in the UK, however. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK.\\n\\n\"The drop was expected as there was no way 2003\\'s record level of production could be bettered,\" the council\\'s spokesperson said. \"The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.\" It was \"too early\" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said. In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures. It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.',\n",

Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\\n\\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\\n\\nLee\\'s answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee\\'s life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York\\'s skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\\n\\n\"Just because he\\'s a hero and has super powers doesn\\'t mean he doesn\\'t have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee\\'s influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel\\'s covers.\\n\\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.',\n",

Apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned. \"When the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel,\" said the festival\\'s executive director, Craig Prater. \"The decision was made that we would continue, but that the focus would change.\\n\\n\"Our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund,\" he continued. \"But we feel like we\\'ve turned a page. We\\'ve acknowledged our position, and now it\\'s business as usual.\"\\n\\nMr Prater\\'s sentiments were echoed by Christine Rush, director of the festival\\'s sister event, the Bangkok Film Market. \"We have been careful to be respectful of the Thai nation\\'s recovery from this terrible disaster,\" she said.\\n\\n\"However, the nation\\'s recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. \"We are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out,\" she added. Given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. However, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.\\n\\nThe eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such Oscar hopefuls as Ray Charles biopic Ray and Mike Leigh\\'s abortion drama Vera Drake. That said, the absence of Thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.\\n\\nOn a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. Problems securing air transport, the clash with last Sunday\\'s Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.\\n\\nBut the festival has still attracted such Hollywood directors as Oliver Stone and Joel Schumacher, alongside such screen stars as Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irons and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Irons, whose film Being Julia is in competition for the festival\\'s Golden Kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after December\\'s catastrophe. \"I questioned whether I should come when such a tragedy had happened,\" the British actor said. \"I thought it might be in rather bad taste. But then I spoke to the organisers and I was encouraged to let life go on. \"Now I\\'ve come here I\\'m very glad. What impresses me about Thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the West,\" he continued. \"Basically I was invited here by Thailand. If they still want you to come, you should.\"\\n\\nNow in its third year, Bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. And while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Pusan in South Korea, Mr Prater predicts it will soon become their equal. \"It\\'s grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,\" he concedes. \"We\\'ve had some bumps in the road, but that\\'s only because the festival is still a baby. \"I have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top Asian film festival in the world.\" The Golden Kinnarees will be awarded on Friday. The festival itself runs until 24 January.',\n",

Corbett, soon to reunite with Ronnie Barker for a new Two Ronnies series, also criticised quiz shows like the BBC\\'s They Think It\\'s All Over. \"It\\'s just laughing at each other and thinking, \\'Aren\\'t we clever?\\'\" said the 74-year-old comedian. Corbett is the latest comedy star to bemoan the \"dumbing down\" of modern TV programmes. In an interview published in the Radio Times in January, Victoria Wood slated comedian Sacha Baron Cohen for his character Ali G\\'s \"horrible\" brand of \"victim\" humour.\\n\\n\"With so many good writers and good performers, it\\'s a shame people can\\'t just write a script and have other people learn it,\" she said. And last week Only Fools and Horses star David Jason criticised British TV for being \"too safe and too cheap\". \"We\\'ve got to be careful not to dumb down for the audience,\" he said. \"They shouldn\\'t be sitting at home on the sofa vegetating.\" Corbett said he and Barker were always mindful of their family audience while making The Two Ronnies. \"Our material was good-natured,\" he said. \"We knew what would upset the average man in the street. \"There\\'s a lot of swearing on TV today. They even have documentaries with the f-word.\"\\n\\nCorbett goes on to criticise \"reality programmes where they put people in a house for a fortnight and film them doing everything\". The Two Ronnies ran from 1971 to 1987 and attracted 17 million viewers at its peak. Its bespectacled stars will return later this year in The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, which will combine classic sketches with newly recorded material. Corbett claims he and Barker differ from today\\'s celebrities in that they did not allow their success to go to their heads. \"We were never temperamental, fractious or walked out slamming doors,\" he said. \"We were fussy though,\" he added. \"We wanted everything done properly.\"',\n",

But from humble beginnings, how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today?\\n\\nHOW IT ALL STARTED The first Academy Awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.\\n\\nJust 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.\\n\\nThe first film to win was Wings, which starred Clara Bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. For the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the Los Angeles Times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. As a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. WHEN AND WHERE The tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.\\n\\nThe ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre the first to host the expanded event. Other venues included the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Shrine Auditorium. They are now held at the Kodak Theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. Until 1954 they were held on a Thursday, then swapped around from Monday to Wednesday before Sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from May to April to March and now its current month of February. The first televised ceremony was in 1953, with Bob Hope as the MC. WHO WAS OSCAR? There is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as Oscar.\\n\\nOne popular story is that Academy librarian Margaret Herrick said the statue looked like her uncle Oscar. A journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.\\n\\nThe first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist Sidney Skolsky used it to describe Katherine Hepburn\\'s first best actress win in 1934. The Academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. The trophy was designed by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons. Since its inception 2,530 Oscars have been handed out. In support of the war effort, the Academy handed out plaster Oscar statuettes during WWII. After the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. Fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. Winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. WHO SITS IN JUDGEMENT? The Academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. Douglas Fairbanks Sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. There are now 5,700 members of the Academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. Some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the Academy, receipt of an Academy Award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. THE STARS WHO LEFT EMPTY-HANDED While many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the Academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.\\n\\nAmong the overlooked films were Hobson\\'s Choice, Dirty Harry, The 39 Steps, The Searchers and King Kong. Actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included Al Jolson in the Jazz Singer (1927), Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (1944), Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain (1952) and Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men (1957). Alfred Hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. His enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. THE SHOW ALWAYS GOES ON Not even war has halted the glittering Hollywood event. There were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in Iraq, but as it didn\\'t stop during World War II or the Vietnam war.\\n\\nDocumentary winner Michael Moore ensured nobody forgot about the Iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the American invasion. The ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. The ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. Los Angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. The death of Martin Luther King saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. CONTROVERSIES AND OTHER GAFFES Three people have refused Oscars, including actor George C Scott who said the whole thing was \"demeaning\". Writer Dudley Nichols refused his Academy Award in 1935 for his screenplay for The Insider because the Writers\\' Guild was striking at the time. Marlon Brando turned down his best actor Oscar for The Godfather in 1973 in protest as Hollywood\\'s apparent discrimination against Native American people. He sent along a woman called Sacheen Littlefeather to collect his award. She was later revealed to be Native American actress Maria Cruz.\\n\\nThe following year Robert Opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. The TV network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. Opal was murdered in 1979. Frank Capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared \"come on up and get it, Frank\" to which Frank Capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant Frank Lloyd had won for Cavalcade.\\n\\nCapra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for It Happened One Night.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Johnny Depp: The acting outlaw\\n\\nJohnny Depp, whose latest role was Peter Pan creator JM Barrie in Finding Neverland, is celebrated as one of Hollywood\\'s most maverick talents. Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits. He has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director Tim Burton. Depp was born in Kentucky in 1963 and at first wanted to be a rock star, playing in a number of bands and supporting acts such as Iggy Pop and The B-52s in Florida. On a visit to Los Angeles, his former wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage.\\n\\nIn 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film Nightmare On Elm Street. Two years later he played a soldier in Oliver Stone\\'s Vietnam epic Platoon. But it was TV that first made Depp a star. He played undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the US series 21 Jump Street for three years from 1987.\\n\\nIn 1990 he began his partnership with Burton in the dark fairy tale Edward Scissorhands, about a young man with blades for hands. He won plaudits in 1993 for the downbeat film What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape, where he played a sensitive youth looking after an overweight mother and a retarded younger brother, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Another role under Burton, Ed Wood, starred Depp as the crazed cult film-maker Wood, in 1994. He played a much more serious, sensitive role in his next major film, Donnie Brasco, where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring. In 1997 he directed his only film to date - The Brave, the story of an Indian man offered money to appear in a snuff film.\\n\\nTwo years later he played Hunter S Thompson in Terry Gilliam\\'s ambitious but poorly-received big screen adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He worked again with Tim Burton in the 1999 horror film Sleepy Hollow, and appeared opposite Dame Judi Dench and Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. His performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, which earned him Golden Globe and Bafta nominations, had many critics thinking he based it upon the mannerisms of his friend, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. His latest role in Finding Neverland explored JM Barrie\\'s relationship with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her children. Depp\\'s charismatic performance drew an audience of adults and children alike into Barrie\\'s vivid imagination, and he was called the \"fifth child of the group\" by the film\\'s director Marc Forster.\\n\\nHe has two children of his own with French singer Vanessa Paradis, having previously been in a long-term relationship with British model Kate Moss. The theme of children\\'s literature in Depp\\'s career - and his long association with Tim Burton - are set to continue in his next role, playing Willy Wonka in a remake of Roald Dahl\\'s classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. British TV comedy fans might also remember Depp\\'s guest role in the final episode of BBC sketch programme The Fast Show, cited as his favourite show. It was another surprise move in Depp\\'s varied and intriguing career.',\n",

The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market. However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (£17.7 billion). The UK CD albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold. On average every Briton buys 3.2 CDs per person per year.\\n\\nAround 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases. Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the UK. \"A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans\\' demand for great music,\" said BPI chairman Peter Jameson. The best-selling album globally was Usher\\'s Confessions - one of eight albums to sell more than five million copies in 2004.\\n\\nThe growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US. The total number of tracks downloaded last year were up more than tenfold on 2003. Digital sales in the US in the first two months of 2005 are already more than double that of the same period in 2004.\\n\\nHowever, some markets in Continental Europe and Asia - notably Sweden, Finland, France, Spain and South Korea - have been drastically hit by internet piracy. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands also saw a decline. \"On the positive side digital sales are booming,\" said John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI). \"However, commercial piracy and illegal file-sharing are continuing to depress our markets. \"The priority in the coming year is to step up the advance of legitimate digital sales and sustain our anti-piracy efforts.\" \"The main choice today\\'s music fan now has to make is whether to get music legally or illegally,\" added Mr Jameson.',\n",

Although an Oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of Hollywood\\'s favourite actresses remains solid. One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening\\'s role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999\\'s American Beauty. But her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of Hilary Swank\\'s leading role in Boys Don\\'t Cry. After opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a Tony Award nomination in 1986 - Bening had a low-key spell in television. She then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988\\'s The Great Outdoors, opposite comics Dan Akroyd and John Candy.\\n\\nFollowing a cameo in Postcards From The Edge, Bening\\'s breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist Myra Langtry in The Grifters - a role that won her an Oscar nomination. Despite some rave reviews, Bening did not win the best supporting actress Academy Award.\\n\\nHowever the high-profile performance enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood productions, co-starring with some of Hollywood\\'s greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford. But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact. Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.\\n\\nBugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe. The couple now have four children together. A pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered Bening\\'s career in the mid-1990s. She played Michael Douglas\\' opposite number in romantic comedy The American President, and as a \"fiery\" Queen Elizabeth I in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare\\'s Richard III.\\n\\nBening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes\\' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance. But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes. The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.',\n",

Both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - Fahrenheit 9/11 breaking US box office records for a documentary, and The Passion of the Christ making more than US$370m (£196m) in the US alone. But this year\\'s Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with The Passion of the Christ - a film accused of being anti-Semitic - receiving nominations only in the \\'minor\\' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.\\n\\nFahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme d\\'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004.\\n\\nMoore\\'s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors\\' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International. But he also believes the strong political viewpoint of Moore\\'s film does not sit well with the Academy. \"If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. Fahrenheit 9/11 didn\\'t really fit in to that category. \"They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren\\'t too contentious,\" he said. While he said the Oscar voting panel were not \"snubbing\" Moore\\'s film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. \"I think it\\'s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,\" he said.\\n\\nThe problem with Mel Gibson\\'s film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language.\\n\\n\"Hollywood doesn\\'t tend to like foreign-language films - no-one\\'s ever tried doing a film in a dead language,\" he said. But aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. The film has caused some controversy in showing Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. But Mr Dams said: \"It\\'s not an inflammatory film. It has done very well in Germany, and it\\'s a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.\" Another \\'contentious\\' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.\\n\\nIndependent film-maker Morgan Spurlock may have forced fast-food giant McDonalds to withdraw its \\'super size\\' portions in the US after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but McDonalds meals - and filmed his progress.\\n\\nThe film has been a hit around the world. Mr Dams said: \"It\\'s a political film, but it\\'s quite fun and punky and well-paced. \"Morgan Spurlock is a really likeable guy. It\\'s a very accessible film, and it doesn\\'t beat you over the head with its views. \"While in Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together - the fact it\\'s a very likeable film - means it\\'s won through on charm.\" Dam\\'s pick at this year\\'s Oscars? The Aviator, Martin Scorsese\\'s biopic of aviation pioneer and Hollywood player Howard Hughes. Tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.',\n",

A candid documentary about the life and career of singer George Michael, A Different Story will also be screened at the 10-day event. \\'\\n\\nDay-Lewis has competed four times at the Berlin Film Festival, with films In The Name Of The Father (1994), The Crucible (1997), The Boxer (1998) and Martin Scorsese\\'s Gangs Of New York (2003). The festival praises him for his \"sensational start\" with roles in My Beautiful Launderette and costume classic A Room With A View, and a \"great number of celebrated roles\" in subsequent productions. Japan\\'s oldest film studio will also be honoured along with Day-Lewis. Shochiku film studios, which was founded 110 years ago, will become the first cinematic institution to receive the Berlinale Camera award. Famous Japanese directors including Akira Kurosawa have had films produced at the studio.',\n",

The work, written for the wedding of a daughter of a German customs official, was missing for 80 years. Joshua Rifkin - a composer and leading interpreter of Bach - has recreated the missing instrumental parts.\\n\\nHe said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata lie in rest. \"Maybe a fragment should stay a fragment,\" said Rifkin. \"Then I thought of palaeontologists, from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur. This is my dinosaur.\" The eight rediscovered pages consist of vocal pieces in German for soprano and alto, with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes. The instrumental parts were entirely lost except for two recycled movements, a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in Bach\\'s work. Rifkin likened the challenge to a \"musical Rubik\\'s cube\". \"I could not reconstruct what Bach wrote but I could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like,\" he said. \"It sounds like Bach\\'s music, but the listener should not know which part is Bach\\'s and which part is mine.\"',\n",

Casino Royale was turned into a spoof spy movie by John Huston in 1967, with David Niven in the lead role. Pierce Brosnan led the past four Bond films but said producers axed him after offering him the chance to return. Among the favourites to take over the coveted role are Scottish actor Dougray Scott, Oscar nominee Clive Owen and Australian star Hugh Jackman. Producers say no decision has yet been made on who will become the seventh actor, including Niven, to play Bond on film. Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino had talked of wanting to take on the Casino Royale project, and said he had spoken to Brosnan about it.\\n\\nShooting on Casino Royale is expected to begin once Campbell has finished work on The Legend of Zorro, a sequel to The Mask of Zorro, starring Catherine Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas. Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson expect the film to be released in 2006.\\n\\nThe script will once again be developed by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who have both worked on two previous Bond movies. Fleming\\'s book saw the introduction of Bond pitted against a Russian spy in a game of baccarat. Simultaneously, a woman arrives on the scene to take his eye off the game. The novel is one of Fleming\\'s most violent and sadistic stories, with 007 suffering a savage beating from his nemesis Le Chiffre. In addition to the 1967 film, it was also adapted for television in 1954 with actor Barry Nelson as an Americanised \"Jimmy\" Bond. MGM Vice Chairman Chris McGurk said: \"Martin (Campbell) is an incredibly exciting film-maker. Goldeneye was a wonderful movie and helped reinvigorate the Bond franchise. We\\'re thrilled to have him back to direct the newest Bond.\" New Zealand-born Campbell moved to the UK in 1966 and directed TV series such as The Professionals, Minder and Bergerac. His film credits include Edge of Darkness, Vertical Limit and Beyond Borders, which starred Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen.',\n",

These include best film, best director and best actress shortlist for Imelda Staunton who plays the eponymous character. The film has spent months being lauded with prizes, from the Venice Film Festival to five awards from the London Critics\\' Circle on Wednesday night.\\n\\nThe Baftas has a tradition of honouring British cinema, and this year Vera Drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. Empire magazine\\'s reviews editor Dan Jolin said the film had \"a very good chance\" of doing well on Saturday, predicting that it would collect five or six awards. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to do a Lord of the Rings-style sweep, but Imelda Staunton is a shoo-in for best actress,\" he said.\\n\\n\"A best director prize for Mike Leigh and best British film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors The Aviator and Finding Neverland.\" Mr Jolin tipped another contender - most likely The Aviator - to walk away with the Bafta for best film, and added that Finding Neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies. Strong Oscar contenders Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.\\n\\n\"There is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back.

Mr Jolin also tipped Phil Davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in Vera Drake but felt that Heather Craney could be outdone by Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman in the supporting actress category. \"If there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the Baftas,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Guardian\\'s film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there \"might well be\" a sweep of awards for Vera Drake on Saturday night. \"I hope that Bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film.

He-Man and Transformers, which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers. With screen versions of The A-Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blake\\'s Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business. But some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released as Sprung! in the US, replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s TV show with polished, computer-generated animation.\\n\\nIn a similar fashion, the 2004 Thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original\\'s puppets and models. The films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. Pop stars Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue provide voices in The Magic Roundabout, while the now-defunct boy band Busted performed the Thunderbirds theme song. But while some reviewers have been won over, there has nonetheless been a significant backlash. \"This CG-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion Roundabout a cult hit,\" writes Stella Papamichael on the BBC Movies site.\\n\\nAnd the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police was in part provoked by its directors\\' outrage that Gerry Anderson\\'s Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. Dan Jolin, reviews editor of Empire magazine, says classic children\\'s TV shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.\\n\\n\"I can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today. \"But I think it\\'s backfiring. What\\'s next - The Clangers on some distant planet, with some giant CGI Soup Dragons chasing after them?\" Despite Thunderbirds\\' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. It can therefore be only a matter of time before some other TV favourites receive the Hollywood treatment.\\n\\nAfter the success of Garfield: The Movie, Britain\\'s shabby tabby\\n\\nsurely deserves his own film vehicle. With only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series, there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat, Professor Yaffle and the Mice of the Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ.\\n\\nFurry recyclers\\n\\nhave already had one big-screen outing - 1977\\'s Wombling Free. But with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. Advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the BBC\\'s supernatural comedy\\n\\n. And the success of Pirates of the Caribbean must surely herald a comeback for TV\\'s most popular cartoon buccaneer,\\n\\n. It might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed.\\n\\nThe Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow about bringing Catweazle to the big screen? He could give Gandalf a run for his money!\\n\\nThundercats!! I loved it. Should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back!\\n\\nGet your hands off the Clangers! Is nothing sacred?\\n\\nMake a movie version of the Banana splits!\\n\\nWhat about Keanu Reeves and Richard Gere in a remake of The Wooden Tops? Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy.\\n\\nYou forgot to mention the grearest of them all, Danger Mouse! But then again, it couldn\\'t be better than the original series, could it?\\n\\nIt\\'s always nice to see these old toons re-released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!) I think I\\'ve been completely put off. Just leave these classics alone as good memories.\\n\\nI think remakes are a good idea. As the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. I believe this is the whole reason \"retro\" has become so popular. As long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. Personally i\\'d like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K. get full Hollywood remakes.\\n\\nLeave them alone, why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place? The thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson.\\n\\nLove to see Transformers with real actors and CGI. And make it at least a 15 rating.\\n\\nPart of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. They were moody, sarcastic, and rather human. Just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. Dougal never smiled like that! Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.\\n\\nI have fond memories of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. It\\'s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. Bod would likely be played by Tom Cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two.\\n\\nIt\\'s all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a \\'new\\' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation. It does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas?\\n\\nAll I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids\\' show ever. I recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child.\\n\\nThere WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original\\'s cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate. We live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration, clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it\\'s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.\\n\\nIt got to be Mr.Benn. The story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop, steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. And who to play the lead role? Well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin. If its going to be an adventure then Johnny Depp playing a role similar to the Pirates Of The Caribbean Character.\\n\\nMuffin the Mule perhaps ? After all, grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know!\\n\\nWhy can\\'t the British film industry try making Gerry Anderson\\'s UFO or Captain Scarlet, or Saphire and Steel, or The Tomorrow People.\\n\\nIn today\\'s media, it seems the past is the future. TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ\\'s are sampling or re-working 70\\'s and 80\\'s music. Even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings. Personally, I think it shows that no one has any originality any more! Why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone.\\n\\nMary, Mungo and Midge. But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. Plus would Mary be more of a Vicky Pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block? Yeah but no but I wasn\\'t even there!\\n\\nI\\'d like to see Mr. Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title role. Sean Connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner.\\n\\nIt demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today\\'s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. There are plany of modern children\\'s book that would make excellent films or TV programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past?\\n\\nMr. Benn with Rowan Atkinson as the lead.\\n\\nWould have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn\\'t come up to scratch. The only one that isn\\'t to be remade as yet is Thundercats, which I\\'d like to see.\\n\\nI\\'m an expat living in Norway, and I recently went through a period of buying the DVDs of many of my favourite children\\'s programs for my 2 daughters. My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!! Very Scandinavian...\\n\\nRainbow!\\n\\nI believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among children because it\\'s original, witty, and modern. The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.\\n\\nHow about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!\\n\\nIf a Transformers movie is indeed on the cards then I\\'ll be the first one on Amazon buying a copy, eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. Repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! I don\\'t care! Till then I\\'ll have to make do with the Citreon C4 advert.\\n\\nI\\'d luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. And who remembers Trap Door voiced by the late Willie Rushden, superb children\\'s programme. Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie??? Or even Jamie and the Magic Torch....hmmmmm, I could go on and on. Danger Mouse? At 34 I\\'m showing my age. :-)\\n\\nNoggin the Nog was one of the best children\\'s programs. The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate\\'s wonderful voices. So in general leave well alone. The originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story.\\n\\nJust imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse\\n\\nBob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks. In the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns, Krusty and Gobo. Will they triumph or will they fail miserably? Find out this Fall.\\n\\nOne puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90. It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe\\'s car. Of course, Gerry Anderson\\'s Supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen, big-budget action. It was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a children\\'t movie that really let it down. After all, the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves.\\n\\nIt\\'s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods, isn\\'t it? I\\'d hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that \\'done in a shed\\' clunkiness and you couldn\\'t recreate the magic. Perhaps if the remakes were done in a \\'Look Around You\\' mock-authentic style I might be interested ...\\n\\nChorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch; that would be mega!\\n\\nThis re-gurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people\\'s ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. The same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material, Will Young etc. The sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. The fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant (e.g. Starsky & Hutch) Hence, the market is saturated with this mindless drivel, but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it!\\n\\nI pray they never do a remake of Chorlton And The Wheelies. I\\'m only 27 and don\\'t remember the series from when it was on TV, but have the set on DVD and it\\'s a classic. The fact it\\'s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today\\'s stuff it looks amateurish. Thats the appeal though, it\\'s so innocent (like Chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.',\n",

They emerged from limos at Leicester Square to an uncertain British climate that threatened rain one moment and promised late winter sunshine the next. But the gods were certainly shining on the thousands of film fans who lined the red carpet to meet their idols. Screaming built up into a crescendo as more and more big name stars appeared. The biggest cheer of the night was reserved for The Aviator star Leonardo DiCaprio, who paused in the chilly February air to sign autographs for the throngs. He said the ear-piercing welcome was \"unlike anything I\\'ve ever encountered. It\\'s very intense and very loud.\"\\n\\nBest actress winner Imelda Staunton, who wore a green chiffon dress that sparkled with sequins and beads, told the BBC News website that Vera Drake was the highlight of her career. Her role as a backstreet abortionist in the gritty low-budget film has already led to a clutch of awards and an Oscar nomination. She said: \"Never in a million years did I think this was going to happen. \"Being here and just being nominated is great, but I hope it means more people will go and see the film as well.\" Rooting for Staunton in the best actress category was Cate Blanchett, herself nominated for her supporting role as Hollywood icon Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator.\\n\\nShivering in a floor-length shimmering Armani dress, the Australian-born actress stopped to sign autographs and joked: \"It\\'s tight but I love it.\" Glamour was also brought to the evening by actress Sienna Miller, supermodel Claudia Schiffer - who was supporting her director husband Matthew Vaughn - Troy actress Diane Kruger and star of the TV programme The OC, Micha Barton. Wearing a caramel-coloured floaty frock by the designer Alexander McQueen, Miller told reporters the red carpet experience was \"intense, nerve-wracking and cold\". The younger stars of British film were also represented in the shape of Emma Watson, who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter films. The 14-year-old said she was hoping to meet DiCaprio and Keanu Reeves but joked that \"they are probably a little too old for me\".\\n\\nActor Christian Slater, who is currently starring in One Flew Over The Cuckoo\\'s Nest in London\\'s West End, was greeted by cries of \"Christian, Christian\" by the ever vocal crowd. Keanu Reeves, who presented the best actress award, said being on the red carpet was an \"exciting\" part of his job. \"It is always surreal and when it is nice, it is nice,\" he said. Martin Scorsese, whose movie The Aviator went on to win best film, said being honoured in the UK meant a lot to him. He said: \"I am a great admirer of British cinema since the 1930s and 40s, up until now.\\n\\n\"They give me a new energy when I see the best coming out of England and every two or three years is a whole new cycle of tough and young film-makers, and even the older ones are making good films. \"To recognise me in this way is a great honour.\" British actor Clive Owen, who has won a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his supporting role in Closer, said it \"meant a lot\" to be at the ceremony. He said: \"Just to be here really, at the Baftas. The bottom line is it is a celebration of British films.\"',\n",

Friends and family, including actress Ruby Dee his wife of 56 years, gathered at the Riverside Church on Saturday. Also present at the service was former US president Bill Clinton and singer Harry Belafonte, who gave the eulogy. \"He would have been a very good president of the United States,\" said Mr Clinton. \"Like most of you here, he gave more to me than I gave to him.\"\\n\\nThe 87-year-old was found dead last weekend in his hotel room in Florida, where he was making a film. Police said that he appeared to have died of natural causes. Davis made his acting debut in 1950 in No Way Out starring Sidney Poiter. He frequently collaborated with director Spike Lee, starring in seven Lee films including Jungle Fever, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X. Attallah Shabazz, the daughter of activist Malcolm X, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by Davis at her father\\'s funeral. \"Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes,\" she said, quoting the man she knew as Uncle Ossie. \"Ditto.\" \"Ossie was my hero, and he still is,\" said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years. \"Ossie was a thing of beauty.\"\\n\\n\"I want so badly someday to have his dignity - a little of it anyway,\" added Burt Reynolds, Davis\\'s co-star in the 90s TV comedy Evening Shade.

They will set up a charity to raise money to buy the Palace Theatre, and hope to reopen it to audiences in summer 2006. It is estimated that £500,000 is needed to buy the Grade II listed building. The Palace Theatre, which will be known as The Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for £340,000. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years.\\n\\nOscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and Charlie Chaplin and Lily Langtry have also trodden its boards. Fox told the South Wales Evening Post that after visiting the theatre he was surprised by its beauty. \"A lot of money needs to be spent on it, but all the bones are there - it just needs a beautiful skin,\" he said.\\n\\n\"To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. There are not many theatres left like this. \"The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough people to come forward to allow it to prosper,\" he told the newspaper.\\n\\nFox first found fame in the 1960s. One of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the Day of the Jackal in 1973, and he won a TV Bafta as the Prince of Wales in 1980 for Edward and Mrs Simpson. He was brought on board to save the theatre by Mr Palmer, a long-standing friend of 40 years. \"Two years ago I decided to return to Swansea and do something for the city,\" said Mr Palmer. He said he was excited by the idea of running the Palace as a charity where young actors could develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the summer. \"If in five years\\' time the theatre can function in all areas without me, I shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,\" he added. Keith Poulton, a business adviser from Swansea, has already committed an undisclosed amount of money to the project. \"We need at least £75,000 to secure a deposit on the building and we\\'ve only got two months to do that,\" said Mr Poulton. \"A few benefactors have expressed their interest and Mr Fox is going to give it an awful lot of time,\" he added. Last year, roads around the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its roof fell onto a car, but engineers said they were happy that it was safe.',\n",

The psychological drama stars Stellan Skarsgard and foreruns the 1973 film. Schrader was replaced by director Renny Harlin who made a new version of the film which debuted in 2004. The prequel project was originally announced in 2001, with actor Liam Neeson in the lead role and John Frankenheimer as director. However Frankenheimer pulled out in 2002, a month before he died.\\n\\nSkarsgard then replaced Neeson in the role of Father Merrin, made famous by Max Von Sydow in the 1973 film. Principal footage was shot in Morocco and Rome at a reported cost of $32m. However, in August 2003 it emerged that producers Morgan Creek were shelving Schrader's version of the film, having complained it was not scary enough. As well as replacing Schrader with Harlin - the director behind Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger - the producers also changed most of the cast, but Swedish star Skarsgard stayed in the Merrin role. Harlin's film, released in the UK in October 2004, received lukewarm reviews but went on to make over $76m (£40.7m) worldwide. The festival screening will be the first time that Schrader's film has been seen in public. Reports that it will be released either in cinemas or on DVD have yet to be confirmed. Other films at the festival in the Belgium capital, which runs from 11-26 March, include the US horror hit Boogeyman and the forthcoming sequel Ring 2, as well as a selection of films adapted from the works of Jules Verne.\",\n",

While the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony. \"We don\\'t have a Titanic or a Lord of the Rings out there. I think it\\'s fair to say it does concern us a bit,\" said Academy executive director Bruce Davis. About 51 million people in the US have seen this year\\'s nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years. The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier\\'s Story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films. Last year\\'s ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see Lord of the Ring: Return of the King sweep the board.\\n\\nAnd the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when Titanic took home 11 Oscars.\\n\\nThe film had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m). \"Eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the TV screen,\" said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"People like to have a vested interest in what they\\'re watching. \"When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you\\'ve got a lot of people with a vested interest.\" Past years have also seen blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Ghost compete for Oscars. The biggest box office hitter among this year\\'s nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only £7m so far.\\n\\nLow-budget move Sideways and Finding Neverland have so far grossed about $45m (£24m) each. The year\\'s biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the Oscar nominees but in the animation category. Shrek 2 and The Incredibles took $436m (£231m) while The Incredibles took $259m (£137m). Mel Gibson\\'s The Passion of the Christ, which took $370m (£196m) in the US, was largely ignored by Academy voters.\\n\\nBut many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. \"I have never equated the Academy Awards with how much money a movie takes in,\" said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray. \"That\\'s the People\\'s Choice Awards.

Buhecha, who made £26,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called \"one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK\" by the sentencing judge. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) worked for two years on the case.\\n\\nAn operation was launched against Buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities. The judge in the case, which lasted seven days, said that \"a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage Buhecha caused to legitimate business\". Fake DVDs were manufactured in Pakistan and Malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by Buhecha, who traded in conterfeit DVDs in 2002 and 2003.\\n\\nIn December 2002, he was stopped in his car by trading standards officers, who uncovered 1,000 pirated DVDs and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks. Despite being arrested and bailed, Buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003. His home and a lock-up in Cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit DVDs and further faked inlay cards. Buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein. Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as \"a major boost\". Bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions. The BPI welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films. The organisation\\'s anti-piracy director David Martin said: \"The problem simply will not disappear with Buhecha. Others and more will take his place, so it\\'s vital that keep up our efforts in this field.\"',\n",

He came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events, which roughly translates a \"celebrity love-in\". This echoed the views of Oscars host and comedian Chris Rock, who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them, calling award shows \"idiotic\". \"As Chris Rock accurately said, they\\'re about celebrity and fashion,\" Mr Strauss said. The recent Grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser, and it seems Oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way.\\n\\nRecently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue. But Entertainment Weekly\\'s Dave Karger maintained the Oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster, such as Titanic or Lord of the Rings, was nominated. The near constant flow of US film awards, representing directors, actors and producers\\' guilds, also means \"few surprises\" are left by the time the Oscar ceremony is upon us, he said. A quick scan of the Los Angeles Times and Los Angeles Daily News bears this out - speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the Times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the Kodak Theatre to protect the red carpet from rain. Variety and the Hollywood Reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news, while in the UK bets have closed on the best actor category, with Ray star Jamie Foxx a dead cert to win.\\n\\nScreen International\\'s US editor Mike Goodridge thinks 2004\\'s films have simply not grabbed the public\\'s imagination. \"Film-makers haven\\'t produced films that people adore this year,\" he said. \"They adored Saving Private Ryan for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money. \"2004\\'s films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a realisation in America that things might not be so rosy after all. \"Audiences don\\'t necessarily want to see darker films such as Million Dollar Baby, Aviator and Finding Neverland, which end with casualty.\" As to whether Rock could pep up the awards, the critics were not hopeful.\\n\\nMr Strauss doubted whether Rock would make an impact, but added: \"I\\'m all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the Oscars.\" Mr Karger said the comic might boost younger viewers, but Mike Goodridge thought Rock\\'s humour could prompt America\\'s conservative states to switch off. So despite all this, did the critics have any views on who would win?\\n\\n\"Clint Eastwood\\'s Million Dollar Baby affected people emotionally, which is why it will beat Aviator, which was about technical artistry not feelings,\" Mr Karger said. \"Eastwood has it in the bag,\" added Mr Strauss. \"Oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads.\" And Mr Goodridge said best film and director were between Martin Scorsese\\'s Aviator and Million Dollar Baby. Mr Karger, whose favourite film of the year was Mike Leigh\\'s abortion drama Vera Drake, stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments. \"I hope this is the year for small films to triumph,\" he said. \"After all, it\\'s still one of the biggest TV events of the year.\"',\n",

Most of the critics tipped Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank to scoop best actor and actress for Ray and Million Dollar Baby respectively. The jury comprised experts and critics from the top UK film publications. The panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win.\\n\\nAll expect The Aviator to win best film, but many think it will be a close race between Scorsese\\'s Howard Hughes biopic and Eastwood\\'s boxing drama Million Dollar Baby. The other films nominated are wine comedy Sideways, factual drama Finding Neverland, and Ray Charles biopic Ray.\\n\\n\"I\\'m pretty sure this is the year of The Aviator, though my own choice would be Sideways,\" said the Observer\\'s Philip French. \"Sideways should win but it doesn\\'t have a hope,\" said Jamie Graham of Total Film, a position shared by Film 2005 presenter Jonathan Ross. \"The form going in to the Oscars points to The Aviator, but I liked Million Dollar Baby more,\" said Tim Dams, news editor of trade weekly Screen International.\\n\\nFive of the eight critics tipped Scorsese to win best director, with Mr Dams, Heat\\'s Charles Gant and Empire\\'s Angie Errigo plumping for Eastwood. Sideway\\'s Alexander Payne, Ray\\'s Taylor Hackford and British director Mike Leigh - nominated for period drama Vera Drake - are considered outsiders in this category. \"Up until recently I could have sworn Scorsese would get it just for being Scorsese,\" Ms Errigo told the BBC News website. \"But I\\'m beginning to think Eastwood will get it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d be very happy for Mike Leigh to win, but I don\\'t think he has any chance,\" said Charles Gant, film editor of Heat. Foxx\\'s portrayal of Ray Charles has already seen him win prizes at the Golden Globes, Baftas and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Mr Dams said this made him \"out-and-out favourite\" to be named best actor on Oscar night. \"Everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didn\\'t win,\" he said. \"If you\\'re a betting man, he\\'s as close as you get to a certainty.\" \"If Paul Giamatti was nominated for Sideways it would be a different game,\" says Total Film\\'s Jamie Graham. \"But Foxx will and should win.\"\\n\\nWith Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton nominated for best actress alongside Kate Winslet, Britain has a good chance of victory - on paper. Jonathan Ross, for one, will be very happy if Winslet wins for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But while Wendy Ide of The Times still thinks Staunton has a chance, Heat\\'s Charles Gant believes her Bafta win will cut little ice with Academy voters. \"I\\'d like Staunton to win, but her chances are not that great,\" said Mr Gant, who predicted a second Oscar for Hilary Swank.\\n\\n\"I think Swank will win,\" said Mr French. \"Imelda has got as far as she\\'s going to get playing that role.\" Staunton is also the personal choice of Steven Gaydos, executive editor of industry magazine Variety. But while he tipped Swank to win, he predicted it would be a close contest. \"Everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way,\" he told the BBC News website. \"There\\'s not a sense that it\\'s obvious how it\\'s going to go.\" Meanwhile, thousands of people have voted in a BBC Radio Five Live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture Oscar. The audience voted overwhelmingly for The Shawshank Redemption, the 1994 Frank Darabont tale of hope and humanity, which received 52% of the online votes and 68% of the text messages. The other two finalists, Citizen Kane and A Matter of Life and Death split the remaining votes roughly equally.

              " {'sequence': 'Briton wins short film Oscar\\n\\nThree of the five nominees in the live-action short film category at this year\\'s Oscars were British. For Andrea Arnold, who won the category, Ashvin Kumar and Gary McKendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight.\\n\\nArnold\\'s gritty drama Wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline, while Kumar\\'s Little Terrorist follows a young Pakistani Muslim boy, who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed Indian border. McKendry\\'s entry, Everything In This Country Must, forces British soldiers and Catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in Northern Ireland. Last week, the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the Academy\\'s headquarters in Beverly Hills. \"I felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen I\\'ve ever seen,\" says Arnold.\\n\\nSet in her native Dartford, Wasp tells the story of a young mum, who, unable to find a babysitter, leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she\\'s on a date. The image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby\\'s mouth. \"The other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say. But I just start with an image I can\\'t shake off, work outwards from that and see what comes out,\" she explains.\\n\\nSince she presented children\\'s TV shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, Arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention. \"I\\'m not interested in the publicity. It\\'s not my personality. I\\'m overwhelmed by all the fuss,\" she said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different. \"But even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at Sundance last month), I\\'d still be proud of it - even if it hadn\\'t won any.\" Asked what the nomination means to her, Arnold says she feels \"flattered and honoured\". \"We\\'ve all been overwhelmed by the response and can\\'t get it in perspective yet. I\\'m still reeling.\"\\n\\nAnd she won\\'t commit to an opinion of Hollywood yet. \"I\\'m just in the middle of it, living moment to moment, day to day.\" But despite her reservations about the Academy Awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it, she accepts that it has opened doors for her. \"People will definitely listen to what I want to do now, and the phone didn\\'t stop ringing for a week after I got nominated.\" As for the future, Arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films. \"You\\'re left more to your own devices, without people interfering as much.\" That said, she is currently working on a feature film with Dogville and Dancer In The Dark director Lars Von Trier.',\n",

Backstage, he said: \"A lot of people say you\\'re due - maybe you are, maybe you aren\\'t - it\\'s an accolade.\" Million Dollar Baby\\'s success was the night\\'s biggest surprise after The Aviator seemed to have the advantage until the end of the ceremony.\\n\\nCate Blanchett, who won for playing late screen legend Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, said her award was \"an indescribable surprise and honour\".

And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \"beautiful legacy\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \"You took a chance, man,\" he said. \"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \"Everybody\\'s drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\"\\n\\nHe broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young. In other awards, cartoon hit The Incredibles won best animated feature and best sound editing. Bittersweet comedy Sideways won best adapted screenplay while the original screenplay prize went to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Born into Brothels, about the children of prostitutes in Calcutta, was named best documentary, The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film and Finding Neverland got the accolade for best musical score.

It was also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who played abortionist Vera Drake in Mike Leigh\\'s film.\\n\\nLeigh had previously received three Oscar nominations for Secrets and Lies and Topsy Turvy. Winslet said she was \"ecstatic\" about the fourth Oscar nomination of her career, this time for her lead role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Among other British talent nominated for Oscars, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart were nominated for best original song for Learn To Be Lonely, from The Phantom of the Opera movie. That award was won by Al Otro Lado Del Rio from The Motorcycle Diaries. Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, was also up for The Phantom of the Opera but lost to The Aviator. Finding Neverland garnered another nomination for British talent, with Gemma Jackson shortlisted for the art direction prize. She lost in that category to The Aviator.

Jurors saw the film, in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim, on Tuesday. Mr Jackson denies 10 charges of child abuse and false imprisonment. If convicted, he could face up to 21 years in prison.\\n\\nMs Kite suggested Jackson\\'s associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser\\'s family after the airing of Martin Bashir\\'s film Living with Michael Jackson. She told the court that in the aftermath of the broadcast, a Jackson lawyer had told her the boy\\'s mother would be made to look like a \"crack whore\". Jackson\\'s defence questioned Ms Kite\\'s credibility, pointing that she worked for the singer\\'s team for less than a week before being fired, and had never met or spoken to the star.\\n\\nMs Kite said she received a phone call on 13 February 2003 from a Jackson associate, Marc Schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the Neverland ranch where they had been staying.\\n\\nMs Kite told the court she had later asked Jackson\\'s lawyer, David LeGrand, what had happened. \"I said, `Don\\'t make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch\\',\" she said. Ms Kite began to work for Mr Jackson in February 2003, after the controversial film was televised in the US and Europe. The documentary sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into Mr Jackson\\'s relationship with the boy. In the film, the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child.\\n\\nQuestioned by the prosecution, Ms Kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius. Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson. The Smoking Gun website publication was \"beyond disaster\", Ms Kite said. Correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury.\\n\\nThe judge is studying whether the prosecution\\'s first witness, reporter Martin Bashir, is in contempt of court. The defence protested after Mr Bashir, who interviewed Jackson for the TV documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a California \"shield\" law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. In the prosecution\\'s opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. He said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was 13 at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.',\n",

She was incredibly capable and talented,\" he said. Carpenter and Hill collaborated on a number of Halloween sequels, including Halloween II, Halloween: Resurrection and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.\\n\\nLater in her career, Hill formed a production company with her friend Lynda Obst, making a string of hit films including Oscar nominee The Fisher King and teen comedy Adventures In Babysitting.

In the 90s she pursued work in TV, although she was reunited with Carpenter in 1996 for Escape From LA, the sequel to Escape From New York. At the time of her death she was working on a film about the last two men pulled from the rubble of the Twin Towers following the 11 September terror attacks in 2001.

The original film, released in 1980, has spawned ten sequels based around mask-wearing murderer Jason Voorhees. The most recent, Freddy Vs Jason, was released in summer 2003. That film saw Jason battle Freddy Krueger, star of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. According to the industry newspaper, New Line had been trying to make another sequel involving Ash, the hero of the Evil Dead movies, but was unable to agree terms with director Sam Raimi. Tarantino is said to be intrigued by the prospect of building a new film around one of the horror genre's most recognised figures. First, however, he is scheduled to direct the season finale of US television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Filming is due to start in early April. Tarantino's episode, for which he also wrote the original story, will be broadcast in the US on 19 May.\",\n",

Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months\\' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n\\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n\\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n\\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n\\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures.

He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\\n\\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\\n\\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party\\'s chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England\\'s Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I\\'m not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\\n\\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown\\'s Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don\\'t think we\\'ll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\\n\\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers\\' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don\\'t give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don\\'t think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him \\'don\\'t increase your public spending, don\\'t give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people\\'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\\n\\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.',\n",

The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.\\n\\nThe NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. \"Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,\" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: \"This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled.\" He added: \"Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.\" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: \"In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.\"',\n",

He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May.\\n\\nIn what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: \"I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street.\" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and \"throwing crockery\". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: \"It\\'s a fight for the future of our country, it\\'s a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win.\"\\n\\nMr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in \"a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward\". Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents\\' policies and then attacking the lies. \"What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it\\'s going to be fear and smear,\" he told BBC News. The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour\\'s six new pledges as \"vacuous\" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. \"We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters,\" he said, insisting he enjoyed a \"warm and constructive\" relationship to Lord Ashcroft.\\n\\nMeanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair\\'s words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday. Mr Kennedy is accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay.

Labour\\'s Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study \"Whose Secretary are You, minister\".\\n\\nThe research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called \"Blair Babes\" elected in 1997, told researchers: \"I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say \\'melons\\' as we spoke.\" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women\\'s legs or their sexual persuasion. And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women \"Betty\".\\n\\n\"When I said, \\'Look you know my name isn\\'t Betty\\', he said, \\'ah but you\\'re all the same, so I call you all Betty\\'.\" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: \"Well, you\\'ve only succeeded because you\\'re a woman.\" Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told: \"Oh, you\\'ve had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?\" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.\\n\\nLiberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: \"Lots of people say it\\'s like an old boys club. \"I\\'ve always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers.\" Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. \"We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes.\" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to \"put up with\" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. But she added: \"Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. \"What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons.\" The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record.',\n",

He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a \"silly fuss\". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour\\'s election campaign.\\n\\nThe e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from \"demonising\" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour\\'s advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour.\\n\\nMr Campbell\\'s e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA\\'s boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: \"Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!\" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side.\\n\\nHe said: \"Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. \"Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. \"Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I\\'m sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. \"Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go.

The spokesman said: \"The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government.\" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had \"very good and polite relations\" with Mr Campbell, who he described as \"very talented\". But on the former spin doctor\\'s use of language, Mr Straw said: \"I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances.

Mr Blair said: \"I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.\" He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster. In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved \"to be completely and publicly exonerated\".\\n\\nThe families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister\\'s Questions in the House of Commons. However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. He said Mr Blair had spoken with \"such sincerity\", adding: \"He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. \"You could see he was moved by what people were saying. \"Tony Blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. It\\'s a day I never thought would come.\" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair\\'s official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would \"ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister\\'s statement brought to them\".\\n\\nMost of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families.

He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family.

She said it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\\n\\n\"The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,\" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven.

The Lib Dems also oppose the plans.\\n\\nThe government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.\\n\\nMr Blair\\'s refusal to accept the Tories\\' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. Peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on Thursday. The bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.\\n\\nThe Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four\\'s the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a \"recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists. He went on to say: \"If we don\\'t get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill.\" In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be \"far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through\".

The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland\\'s binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been \"obscured\" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.\\n\\nThe one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: \"I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. \"If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it.\" However, he added that \"perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage\".\\n\\nMr MacDonell said: \"I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. \"But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.\" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland\\'s fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: \"I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. \"This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.\" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were \"off the mark\", they were bound to \"come back and bite him\". He added: \"Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. \"I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.\"\\n\\nThe Scottish National Party\\'s Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his \"ill-judged comment\" and withdraw it immediately.

Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. \"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.\\n\\nHis main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. \"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,\" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. \"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.\" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\". The QCA said the potential \"step-change in participation and attainment\" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. \"Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,\" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA\\'s concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not \"close too many doors\" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.\\n\\nThe chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. \"One of the reasons why I\\'m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it\\'s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,\" he said. \"If we don\\'t say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity.\" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers\\' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in \"functional\" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms\\' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson\\'s predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a \"massive upheaval\". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.',\n",

Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the \"cornerstone\" of Labour\\'s programme.\\n\\nIn a speech at Edinburgh\\'s Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months \"a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term\".\\n\\n\"In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001.

It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard. Pointing to national insurance, he added: \"Everyone knows tax will go up under Labour: isn\\'t it now clear which tax it would be?\"\\n\\nMr Blair instead hailed Labour\\'s achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. \"When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,\" he said.

Tory leader Michael Howard said Lord Butler had given the \"most damaging testimony\" he could remember. But Downing Street said Mr Blair should be judged by results not his style.\\n\\nLord Butler said Mr Blair bypassed the Cabinet and relied instead on small, informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. The prime minister\\'s official spokesman said the Cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. But he added: \"You cannot, in a modern government, take every decision in Cabinet. It\\'s just not possible.\"\\n\\nLord Butler said the government had too much freedom to \"bring in bad Bills\" and \"to do whatever it likes\" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. The former cabinet secretary said in an interview with The Spectator magazine: \"I would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling, there is too much central control and there is too little of what I would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments.\" Mr Howard described Lord Butler\\'s intervention as \"very important\". \"This is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the Blair government. \"It is certainly the most damaging testimony I can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position.\"\\n\\nLord Butler\\'s report earlier this year into Iraq intelligence said the government\\'s September 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was \"very thin\". The reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers\\' case for war, Lord Butler said in his Spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine\\'s editor, Conservative MP Boris Johnson. He said: \"When civil servants give material to ministers, they say these are the conclusions we\\'ve drawn, but we\\'ve got to tell you the evidence we\\'ve got is pretty thin. \"Similarly, if you are giving something to the United Nations and the country you should warn them.\"\\n\\nAsked why he thought the warnings were not there Lord Butler said: \"One has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. The purpose of the dossier was to persuade the British why the government thought Iraq was a very serious threat.\"\\n\\nWhen asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole, he replied: \"Well. I think we are a country where we suffer very badly from Parliament not having sufficient control over the executive, and that is a very grave flaw. \"We should be breaking away from the party whip. The executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad Bills, a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. \"All that is part of what is bad government in this country.\" Lord Butler\\'s assessment was backed by his predecessor as Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong. Lord Armstrong told BBC Two\\'s Newsnight: \"I agree ... there doesn\\'t appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect.\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell said he thought Lord Butler\\'s comments were \"well justified\" and Mr Blair\\'s style of leadership was \"corrosive of the whole system of government\". But Labour former minister Jack Cunningham accused Lord Butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming Labour administration, when he was cabinet secretary. Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"Taken together, Robin Butler\\'s comments are partial, inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the Labour government.\"',\n",

Other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. Mr Straw said the move would save £6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism.\\n\\nHonorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. Nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed, mostly in Europe and America.\\n\\nThey include Dallas in the US, Bordeaux in France and Oporto in Portugal, with local staff replacing UK representation in another 11. The changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006, with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. Some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. In a written statement, Mr Straw said: \"The savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\\'s strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. \"Some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. \"In Africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in Nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering Maseru and Mbabane.\"\\n\\nThe Foreign Office currently has about 6,100 UK-based staff. It has opened major new missions on Baghdad and Basra in Iraq, Kabul in Afghanistan and Pyongyang in North Korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. Since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding Wednesday\\'s cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. The shake-up is aimed at helping making £86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. The chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. \"But the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that British commercial interests and the interests of Britons abroad will not be adversely affected,\" he said.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Labour targets \\'hardcore truants\\'\\n\\nA fresh crackdown on persistent truants in England has been launched by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly.\\n\\nSerial truants make up one in 13 pupils. Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics. Parenting contracts, penalty notices and \"fast track\" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. It is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. Tories say Labour\\'s previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school. Such absences are often due to family holidays.\\n\\nHowever, serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing £885m. Those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. Measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child\\'s attendance improved. The tough stance paid off with just 24 issued, while attendance improved in 776 cases. Truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government\\'s Behaviour Improvement Programme. This is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since September.\\n\\nThe new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on Monday. Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. Held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school. In almost 14,000 of those cases, the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. A Department for Education and Skills source said: \"Every day in school counts. \"It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation\\'s truancy.\"',\n",

He said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales. News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his \"gracious apology\" and the review itself. But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be \"dragged\" to face MPs.\\n\\nIn its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be \"graded\" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.\\n\\nBut the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. But it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was \"indefensible and should cease\".\\n\\nA key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: \"Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. \"Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence.\" The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.',\n",

A bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales has begun in the Court of Appeal. The ban comes into force on 18 February. The Court of Appeal is expected to rule early next week on whether the alliance\\'s challenge has succeeded.

Pro-hunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in London\\'s High Court on Thursday.

Opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges.

Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: \"It is not householders who should be frightened, it\\'s the burglars.\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.\\n\\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using \"grossly disproportionate\" force could be prosecuted. The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. He told MPs: \"If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law.\" Instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. He said: \"We\\'ve had three policy positions in three months and two U-turns. \"It\\'s not surprising Gordon Brown told him: \\'There\\'s nothing you could say to me now that I could ever believe.\\'\"\\n\\nMr Howard said the \"grossly disproportionate\" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. The barrister who had represented Mr Martin had said the rules were \"weighted overwhelmingly\" in favour of the householder, said Mr Clarke. He said: \"The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Sir John Stevens was making and the prime minister was making.\" The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said.

He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. On the Asian tsunami he said it had been \"very heartening\" to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons. Mr Kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period. At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.\\n\\nThe general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party \"fades away\" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said. \"A clear division is emerging in British politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. \"Labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity. While the Conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the European \\'menace\\',\" he said. He said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.\\n\\nIt was already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison, ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said. He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and ID card plans. He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. \"But at the same time, an overmighty state is a dangerous one,\" he said. His party \"instinctively\" understood the \"new liberal Britain\" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said. \"We are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. \"Our national institutions are changing too. We are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. In our attitudes and the way we live our lives, this is in many ways a liberal Britain.\"',\n",

Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be \"crass and ignorant\" to liken a quango review to Hitler\\'s Germany. But Ms James emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom. The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.\\n\\nIt was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control. The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government\\'s umbrella. But Ms James, who won the £30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government. Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: \"It\\'s quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it\\'s not like the health service and it\\'s not like the railways. \"Free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society. You need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way.\"\\n\\nBut she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate.\\n\\nShe told Good Morning Wales: \"Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler\\'s Germany, the actual quote I gave was: \\'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control\\'. \"As we know from past European history, i.e. Russia and Germany in the early 20th Century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression\\'. \"Artists need a free voice to express themselves - they reflect a truth through their own art forms.\\'\" She said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in Wales.\\n\\nShe added: \"It would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts. It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don\\'t think the government has the expertise. \"If you have the National Assembly taking control, I fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs.\\n\\n\"Wales has moved on. It is international now. It is not set back in How Green Was My Valley?\" Responding to Ms James\\' criticisms, Mr Pugh said: \"The structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly. \"Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler\\'s Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability.\" Ms James, whose father was Welsh, was born in Melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre.

Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\\n\\nThe House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government\\'s anti-terror policy.\\n\\nBut Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government\\'s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords\\' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\\n\\nThe ruling came on Charles Clarke\\'s first day as home secretary following David Blunkett\\'s resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\\n\\n\"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office\\'s powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\\n\\nIn a statement, detainee \\'A\\' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal \\'law\\' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Profile: David Blunkett\\n\\nBefore he resigned the position of home secretary on Wednesday, David Blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race, policing and immigration.\\n\\nHis responsibilities in running the Home Office included civil emergencies, security, terrorism and expenditure. Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. The attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. A Labour loyalist from a working class background Mr Blunkett, 57, had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to Labour policy.\\n\\nRecently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. Mr Blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister Beverly Hughes. Having received his full backing, Ms Hughes was forced to resign in April over abuses in the visa processing system, which she claimed to be unaware of. Mr Blunkett\\'s own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo to \"get back home\" to start rebuilding their countries. And he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a \"sense of belonging\" in Britain, telling them to speak English at home. Avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary, who spurns a metropolitan elite and \"airy fairy libertarians\" and earlier in the year coined the phrase \"liberati\", as an amalgam of \"glitterati\" and \"liberal\". Yet in January of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis, from a Grade B to Grade C status drug .\\n\\nBefore the recent furore, Mr Blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. Mr Blunkett told the Daily Telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring, in spite of being a divorcee, as \"a useful way of ensuring that people don\\'t casually think I am available\". He added: \"I am not available because I am just getting on with the job.\" Mr Blunkett entered Parliament for Sheffield Brightside in 1987, after first contesting the Sheffield Hallam seat in 1974. He is one of very few blind MPs, and was the first to reach the front bench and the Cabinet. His relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box, in the Labour Party\\'s National Executive, and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. Mr Blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply \"an inconvenience\". Using Braille for speeches, and briefed by his officials on tape, he also has a sharp tongue at times, and a pragmatic approach to politics.\\n\\nMr Blunkett was schooled in Sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the Commons. He chaired the Labour Party nationally, and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s, shadowing health and education. In Tony Blair\\'s first government Mr Blunkett was put in charge of education and employment, where he won big increases in funds for schools, while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. He was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. In the Labour Party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague, a conciliator who avoids factions, and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. There have been wry smiles as well. In 1999, his then guide dog Lucy threw up in the Chamber during the speech of his Tory opponent. Lucy was replaced by her half-sister, Sadie, a black Labrador-curly-coated retriever cross, in 2003 after nearly a decade by Mr Blunkett\\'s side.',\n",

They believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made.\\n\\nIt is thought the proposed overhaul, due on Thursday, could mean pensions could be based on a \"career average\" salary. For each year served, staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May. In a statement on Sunday, the Cabinet Office said it was reviewing the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and hoped to announce proposals soon. \"Unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes. \"Public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. People are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive. \"To maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme, the government announced in its Green Paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65.\" On Monday, Tony Blair\\'s official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. He said: \"What\\'s important is that there\\'s a process going on, it\\'s out for consultation at the moment, let\\'s wait for that process to complete itself.\"\\n\\nThere is already widespread anger over the chancellor\\'s plans to get rid of more than 100,000 civil servants. Now public service unions are united against the plans and the Trades Union Congress is discussing the issue next Monday. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. \"Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away,\" he said. \"What really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of MPs who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in Europe, but say they can\\'t afford it for anyone else. \"This is a position that Unison cannot accept and will oppose. It will lead to conflict between Unison and the government, if not this year then next.\"\\n\\nMr Prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. Mark Serwotka, from the Public and Commercial Services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. The Fire Brigades Union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. Pensions officer Paul Woolstenholmes said: \"The pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from MPs and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.\"',\n",

The Parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give Kimberly Quinn free rail tickets. He is also being investigated over the visa application of Mrs Quinn\\'s ex-nanny. The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by Mr Blair.\\n\\nOn Wednesday during Prime Minister\\'s Questions, Tory leader Michael Howard went on the offensive over comments Mr Blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. He is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his Cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. Mr Howard said Mr Blunkett had complained he had inherited a \"giant mess\" when he took over at the Home Office from Jack Straw, now foreign secretary. The Tory leader went on: \"He doesn\\'t stop there: he thinks the culture secretary\\'s weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn\\'t think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn\\'t developed as expected. \"He says the prime minister doesn\\'t like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully.\" Mr Blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.\\n\\nThe home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets, given to him as an MP, to Mrs Quinn and has since paid the £180 back. He has apologised for \"a genuine mistake\" and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. The rail tickets are meant to help MPs\\' spouses get between Westminster and their constituencies. After his inquiry, Parliamentary watchdog Sir Philip Mawer will report to the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee, the group of MPs who will recommend to the full House of Commons what action - if any - should be taken against Mr Blunkett.\\n\\nThe separate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant Sir Alan Budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fast-track a bid by Mrs Quinn\\'s nanny, Leoncia Casalme, to stay in the UK. Last week, Mr Blunkett won the first round of a High Court battle with Mrs Quinn for access to her son. Mr Blunkett declined to comment about his own position, saying the inquiry was under way and the High Court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability. Downing Street has stressed Mr Blair\\'s support for the home secretary.',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Student \\'fee factor\\' played down\\n\\nA rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland.\\n\\nHowever, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out. Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. Fears had been expressed that a flood of \"fee refugees\" would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3,000 a year being introduced in England. In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by £2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.\\n\\nThe figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas. Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out. Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor. He told BBC Radio Scotland\\'s Good Morning Scotland programme: \"The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.\\n\\n\"They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated. \"However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here.\" Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.\\n\\nAlso, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales, where there are no plans for top-up fees, have also risen, by 19%. Mr Wallace said: \"Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain. \"We want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland. \"We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. \"Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.\"',\n",

The MPs said they were \"concerned\" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said.\\n\\nThey called for a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect \"kept animals\" and \"companion\" animals by setting up a \"duty of care\". In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing \"mutilation\" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal\\'s best interest.\\n\\nThe environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. One was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail. \"We accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government\\'s intention to exempt fishing as an activity.\"\\n\\nBut the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. \"However, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given \\'carte blanche\\' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity,\" the committee added. The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which \"would be significantly weakened\". MPs urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.\\n\\nCommittee chairman Michael Jack said: \"Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. \"This draft bill is no exception. My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn\\'t just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place.\" But Mr Jack said the bill \"very much had the feel of a \\'work in progress\\', and urged the government to guarantee that \"an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law\" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms. \"The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament,\" he added.',\n",

But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now. \"ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society,\" he said. Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been \"significantly influenced\" by the recommendations of the Commons\\' home affairs committee.\\n\\nThe issue would be debated in Parliament next Monday as scheduled he insisted. Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as \"deeply flawed\" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors. \"Wouldn\\'t this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place?\" he asked. Earlier this week the Tories announced they would back the government\\'s plans although Michael Howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.\\n\\nThey had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo.

The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them. The new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. And there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to £1,000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to £2,500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory.

Mr McConnell said the country\\'s health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\\n\\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\\n\\n\\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \\n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \\n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \\n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \\n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \\n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \\n \\n\\nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\\n\\nThe Scottish National Party\\'s Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister\\'s brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party\\'s health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.',\n",

Courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, MPs said. But they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.\\n\\nCurrently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. \"An arbitrary \\'template\\' imposed on all families, whatever the needs of the child, would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position,\" the MPs said.\\n\\nThey said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. This would \"reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety\", they said. Delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed \"a new \\'status quo\\' arrangement for the children to become established by default\", they said.\\n\\n\"Although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias, there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present. \"Given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases, we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents.\" Committee chairman Alan Beith said the five-month inquiry had been a \"complex and emotive\" one. \"At the moment, far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation,\" he said. \"This situation has to change. The court system should only be used as a last resort, where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with. \"This will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.\"',\n",

But despite a £65,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. Other ex-Russian spies have been given civil service pensions. \"Hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. It can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case - without that it will not work,\" Mr Makarov told the BBC\\'s Newsnight programme. \"Since I came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other.\"\\n\\nOleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was \"very happy\" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. Commenting on Mr Makarov\\'s case, he said: \"The British state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week.\" But Mr Makarov\\'s case has been backed by David Kahn - a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code-breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies. \"I believe the government of the United Kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that Victor Makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold,\" Mr Kahn said.\\n\\nMr Makarov joined the KGB in 1970s Russia, as an idealistic 20 year-old. One of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was Vladimir Putin. At KGB headquarters in Moscow, he was posted to the secret 16th directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the West. By the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant - and was privy to the thoughts of Western powers. But he had became deeply disenchanted with the Soviet regime - fuelled by its repression both at home and in Poland.\\n\\nThrough his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 - and then began passing secrets to the British intelligence service. He spied for MI6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to Perm 35 - a Soviet hard labour camp in the Artic circle. Within a week of his release in 1992, he made contact with the British authorities he\\'d been spying for, who arranged a meeting between him and an MI6 agent in Latvia. He was given a false passport, and he says, promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average UK citizen. But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. After long periods of living in bedsits, with deteriorating health, four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for £65,000 to buy a small house. But he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work, something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. Government sources told the BBC they had reached a final settlement with the former spy, which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.',\n",

She told BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost: \"It is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom. \"We have made huge progress on the really difficult cases, the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.\\n\\n\"But quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled. \"I would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision.\" It is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. Head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school, who sexually abuse pupils or other people, who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. Ms Kelly entered the Cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then Home Secretary David Blunkett. Her links to Opus Dei, which means \"Work of God\" in Latin, have provoked controversy.\\n\\nCritics say the organisation, which adheres strictly to Catholic teachings, is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. Asked if she was a member of the group, Ms Kelly said: \"I do have spiritual support from Opus Dei and that is right. \"But those are private spiritual matters and I\\'m sure you\\'ll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life.\" She categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. Her collective responsibility as a Cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas, she argued.\\n\\nThe government has yet to issue its official response to the Tomlinson review, which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. Ms Kelly said reforms should build on GCSEs and A-levels. Her comments did not impress Tory shadow education secretary Tim Collins. \"Ruth Kelly wants to ditch the Tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place,\" he said. \"She also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. This is an all talk agenda that lets down children, teachers and parents.\"',\n",

A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britain\\'s young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation\\'s heritage as part of the government\\'s new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \"other cultural identities\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.\\n\\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bell\\'s comments were \"highly irresponsible\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called \\'Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society\\'. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\" said a Home Office spokesman. \"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.\\n\\n\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \"This strategy sets out the government\\'s commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.\\n\\nThe Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools.',\n",

Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained. But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.\\n\\nIn December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. The EU\\'s move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a \"product of the Cold War\". German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end. \"I have long understood China\\'s argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don\\'t think it is,\" he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls. He said \"it is more likely than not\" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July. But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. \"If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now.\"\\n\\nMr Straw said the US government was suspicious of \"the motives of some other countries within the EU\" in wanting the ban lifted. But he said many of Washington\\'s objections were based on a \"lack of information and understanding\" of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries. And \"intense discussions\" were taking place with US officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.',\n",

In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.\\n\\nThere were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. \"While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,\" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\\n\\nEven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\\n\\nThe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.',\n",

The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq as a \"terrible\" waste of money. He and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both spoken out about the war.\\n\\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\\'s Thought for the Day slot, he criticised the fact that \"billions\" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people \"out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease\". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to \"make history poverty\". He added: \"If the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war, that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears.\" The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is \"worth, always, striving for\".\\n\\n\"How is it that peace has not arrived?,\" the cardinal will ask. \"How is it that there is war in Iraq, violence in the Holy Land, and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace?\" \"How can one wish a happy Christmas for our fellow Christians in Iraq or in the Holy Land or those who suffer in Africa unless you and I, in whatever way is open to us, say and do what makes for peace?\" Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in Iraq before the war started. Dr Williams has since criticised the government over its case for war, saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system.\\n\\nOn Friday, the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. \"It is possible, it is real, it is worth, always, striving for, because of the promise of Our Saviour,\" he will say. \"I also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. \" A spokesman said Downing Street had no comment to make.

Last year MAB, which opposed the war in Iraq, urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections. But a spokesman stressed the meeting was \"not necessarily anti-Labour\". \"This meeting is not anti-party in particular, it\\'s anti-policy, it\\'s on the issues we are going to ask Muslims to vote on,\" MAB spokesman Dr Azzam Tamimi said of Tuesday\\'s event.\\n\\n\"There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.\" Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic, social and education problems.\\n\\nApproximately 1.1m of the UK\\'s 1.6m Muslims are of voting age. Previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted Labour, but more recent studies have suggested Labour support has been falling away significantly among some Muslim voters.\\n\\nAnger over the war in Iraq has appeared to be the main reason, with many saying it was \"unjustified\". Representatives from a number of Muslim organisations will attend Tuesday\\'s event. Among them will be the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The chairman of the MCB\\'s public affairs committee, Sher Khan, said the war in Iraq would be a \"significant factor\" affecting Muslims\\' voting intentions. \"I think it\\'s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact,\" Mr Khan said.\\n\\nHowever, Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make. \"For the most part the Labour constituencies where there\\'s a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe,\" Professor Curtice said.\\n\\nThe constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added. In Bethnal Green, former Labour MP George Galloway, who founded the anti-war party Respect, is standing against sitting MP Oona King, who had a 10,000-vote majority in 2001. In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour\\'s Lorna Fitzsimons. But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box. \"Ironically the Tories might be the beneficiaries if Labour does lose seats, which is generally the case,\" he said. But Dr Tamimi said MAB\\'s intention was not to \"empower\" the Tories. \"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly. \"If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that\\'s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,\" Dr Tamimi said.',\n",

He added: \"The power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and I find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time.\" He said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the Royal Prerogative. The Liberal Democrats have promised to raise the issue in Parliament.\\n\\nAmnesty International UK also questioned whether the decisions had been based on \"torture evidence\" obtained at Guantanamo Bay. \"Furthermore, we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the UK in the detention of UK residents and nationals and possibly many others at Guantanamo Bay,\" said director Kate Allen. The men\\'s solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. But the Pentagon told BBC News US policy \"condemns and prohibits\" torture and said there was no evidence that any British detainee was tortured or abused. Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. Mr Mubanga, 29, from north London, was originally detained in Zambia.',\n",

Those charged included Otis Ferry, the 22-year-old son of rock star Bryan Ferry and Luke Tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes William and Harry. They were charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act, police said.\\n\\nFive of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them. The men\\'s solicitor Matthew Knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.\\n\\n\"There is no offence of trespassing in the House of Commons - it is not a criminal offence,\" he said. \"If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can\\'t do so retrospectively. \"We are not prosecuted for that. We are prosecuted for a Public Order Act offence. We are not guilty of it.\" They will appear at Bow Street Magistrates\\' Court on 21 December, a police spokesman said. Otis Ferry, a former Eton pupil and joint leader of the South Shropshire Hunt, said: \"I have no regrets. \"We have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country.\" One of the men, David Redvers, 34, from Hartpury, Gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.\\n\\nThe other protesters are John Holliday, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire, Robert Thame, 34, who plays polo with Princes Charles in Team Highgrove, auctioneer Andrew Elliot, 42, from Bromesberrow, near Ledbury, point-to-point jockey Richard Wakeham, 34, from York, and former royal chef Nick Wood, 41. The 15 September protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in Parliament Square. Four of the men ran out from behind the speaker\\'s chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. The five tried to confront MPs before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. Three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.\\n\\nSpeaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales. However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. Last week, the Countryside Alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. The alliance said the 19 February meets would show the new law was \"impossibly difficult to determine\" and open to different interpretations.',\n",

Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday. He denied fathers\\' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC \"there is a recognition that something is wrong\". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.\\n\\nLord Falconer told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include:\\n\\n\\n - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past \\n - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases \\n - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet \\n - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. \\n \\n\\nJudges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a \"nuclear option\" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child\\'s interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a \"medium range\" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.\\n\\nFailure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: \"Tagging may be going too far, but let\\'s have a debate about that.\" Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published \"in the next two weeks,\" a spokesman said.\\n\\nThe government\\'s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers\\' rights groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: \"It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.\" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals \"lacked compulsion\".\\n\\n\"We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. \"Otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart.\" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children\\'s Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May.\\n\\nThe Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that the government\\'s plans were \"inadequate\" and were \"papering over the cracks of the current system\". She said a Conservative government would bring a \"radical reform\" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a \"legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation\". \"We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,\" she added. The government says children cannot simply be divided up \"like property\" when a marriage collapses. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having \"rigid targets\".',\n",

The Mental Capacity Bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment. But Christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate.\\n\\nMinisters insist the Mental Capacity Bill - for England and Wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.\\n\\nThe bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. It would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors. Critics fear it could allow \"killing by omission\" through withdrawing treatment. An amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. Ninety one MPs have signed a petition backing the amendment. MPs could vote on it later on Tuesday, during the bill\\'s report stage debate. The Bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the Lords, before becoming law.\\n\\nThe Christian Medical Fellowship (CMF) and Lawyers\\' Christian Fellowship (LCF) said the Mental Capacity Bill would allow euthanasia by the \"back door\". Peter Saunders of the CMF said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory, not legally binding. \"CMF is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take,\" he said.\\n\\nThe LCF\\'s Andrea Williams said there were \"too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors\". Ex-Labour minister Frank Field told BBC Two\\'s Newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to \"do away\" with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets.\\n\\nConstitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy said laws affecting 750,000 people with dementia needed updating. Mr Lammy told BBC News Labour MPs would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened, not changed. \"We are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law,\" he said. \"Doctors are saying they want more clarity. Patients are saying they want more clarity.\" The Making Decisions Alliance, which includes the Alzheimer\\'s Society, Age Concern, Mencap and the National Autistic Society, said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up. \"It will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity,\" the alliance said in a statement. The British Medical Association also backs the bill, saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. Debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the UK because of cases like that of motor neurone patient Diane Pretty.

They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain\\'s biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.\\n\\nThe five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn\\'t it ironic that they\\'re saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it\\'s completely unacceptable.\"\\n\\nUnison\\'s 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers\\' Union\\'s 70,000 and Amicus\\' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout.

The Lib Dems also oppose the proposals, but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.\\n\\nThe government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. New Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has backed the control orders, saying: \"I\\'m sorry. It is a dilemma, but there is only one choice.\" But Mr Howard said: \"We have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the British way of life.\"\\n\\nHe argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial.

But the prime minister says it is time for Mr Livingstone to say sorry.\\n\\nLabour\\'s Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked. Later the prime minister said: \"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise.\"\\n\\nHowever, Mr Johnson, who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about Liverpudlians grieving over the death of British hostage Ken Bigley, said Mr Blair \"should butt out of\" the row. \"I don\\'t see why the prime minister has to get involved in this,\" The Spectator editor told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. \"It\\'s a dispute between Ken Livingstone and a reporter on the Evening Standard.\" Mr Johnson, MP for Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, said he suspected Labour was now trying to reassure Jewish voters \"because of this curious way in which Labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned Muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war\".\\n\\n\"Ken doesn\\'t think he\\'s got anything to say sorry for and if that\\'s really his feeling, then I think that he should stick to his guns,\" he said.

It says there is \"little evidence\" the MoD\\'s performance had improved, despite the introduction of a \"smart acquisition\" policy six years ago. A senior defence official told the BBC lessons were being learned. The NAO\\'s annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach £50bn - 14% higher than originally planned. The total delays amounted to 62 months, with average individual delays rising by three months.\\n\\nSir John Bourn, head of the NAO, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. \"Many problems can be traced to the fact that the MoD has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,\" the report says. The NAO found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older \"legacy projects\", such as the Eurofighter. A senior defence official, speaking to the BBC\\'s defence correspondent Paul Adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. This year\\'s overspend was significantly less than last year\\'s £3.1bn total, and the Defence Procurement Agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving.\\n\\nLord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement, said he was \"obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown\", but insisted that the Defence Procurement Agency had \"undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects\". The latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months, and, according to our correspondent, contain few new surprises. Turning around the Defence Procurement Agency \"was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed\", he said. Our correspondent said it was the same projects, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the Nimrod and A400M aircraft and the Type 45 Destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay. But he added some projects, such as the C-17 heavy lift aircraft and Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF), were showing good performances.',\n",

Children\\'s charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. But the Home Office says it may be in the children\\'s best interests if it reunites them with their communities.\\n\\nThe pilot, included in the government\\'s five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.\\n\\nSince 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These children automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities. Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.\\n\\nUnder the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the \"best interest\" of a child in their care. Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania.\\n\\n\"If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,\" she said. \"We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania]. \\'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.\" In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing \"the difficult issue\" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children \"and leave them to rot\". \"We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,\" said the spokesman. \"We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it\\'s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.\\n\\n\"We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children\\'s legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities.\" The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations. Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said. But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. \"From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,\" said Mr Hogg. \"In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. \"The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.\" A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.',\n",

The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected. But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election.\\n\\nThe proposed scheme would mean voters using individual \"identifiers\" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard. And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. Non-British citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.\\n\\nMr Younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. He argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at \"hard to reach\" voters, for example. Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail\\'s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.\\n\\nHe argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. He said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. Currently, British voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. Mr Younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.',\n",

But a target of 1.5 million more by 2010 needed \"creative\" ideas. Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers.\\n\\nAccording to the report, \"more than half\" the qualifications achieved were by learners aged 16 to 18. These are defined as \"adults\" by the government for the purpose of compiling these figures. Normally adults are defined as being aged over 19. The number of these people gaining qualifications was \"rising slowly\". Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: \"Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. \"More people will have the opportunity to live richer lives.\" In 2001, the government launched the Get On scheme - aimed at reducing illiteracy and innumeracy. Sir John said \"substantial progress\" had been made since, adding that this was \"only the beginning\". The government and its partners would \"need to be creative and responsive\". Some £3.7bn will be spent on implementing the programme by 2006. The report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand. Existing adult learners could use their \"enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge\" to attract other people. The Department for Education and Skills could also use more \"personalised learning\" and work with voluntary groups, councils and employers.\\n\\nIt should also assess adult learners\\' progress \"at frequent intervals\", the report adds. When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was \"only the start of the journey\". An estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level. This is thought to cost the UK economy hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government\\'s scheme range up to GCSE equivalents. Get On\\'s participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010, with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007. Education minister Ivan Lewis said: \"We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace.\" Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: \"This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour\\'s failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life. \"Employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of school-leavers without these basic skills, but all the government have offered is more talk.\" Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis added: \"Far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives.\"',\n",

The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the Tories set to campaign for a \"no\" vote.\\n\\nMr Ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade.

He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. Tories and Lib Dems welcomed the report and called for a \"slimming down\".\\n\\nConservative deregulation spokesman John Redwood said: \"The research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos, and slimming down the rest.\\n\\n\"A Conservative government will axe 162 quangos, as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government.\" Lib Dem spokesman Ed Davey meanwhile said instead of the \"bonfire of quangos\" New Labour had promised, there had been an \"explosion\" of them. \"For over two decades, under both Tory and Labour governments, these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed. \"Liberal Democrats would abolish many, merge others, and make any that remain properly accountable.\" Labour representatives were unavailable for comment. The quango guide follows last year\\'s government-commissioned Gershon Report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector.\\n\\nMr Lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost £1.8bn a year - cash he says which \"appears to be almost entirely wasted\". As well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. He also listed what he dubbed the nine \"most useless quangos\". They were the British Potato Council, the Milk Development Council, the Energy Savings Trust, Agricultural Wages Committees, the Wine Standards Board, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Football Licensing Authority, Investors in People UK and the Economic and Social Research Council. Mr Lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee Potato Council, set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets, \"surprising\". He said the £80m spent annually on the Energy Savings Trust, which promotes renewable energy, would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for British homes.\\n\\nAnd he argued it was \"absurd\" to charge farmers for Agricultural Wages Committees, which set working and wage standards in the industry, when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £1 an hour. \"If a football team can afford to pay £27m for Wayne Rooney, why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the Football Licensing Authority to the tune of over £1.1m a year?\" Mr Lewis asked. The report is published by the Efficiency in Government Unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the Economic Research Council and the Centre for Policy Studies. It says before a new public body is set up, an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.',\n",

The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body\\'s tissue types.

He added: \"Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. More research needs to be done. But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. The hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved.\" Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident.

There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. Some charities say the plans would put refugees\\' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.\\n\\nTony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.\\n\\nIn a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It\\'s not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\" He said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that \"firm but fair\" immigration controls were essential for good community relations.\\n\\n\\n - Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers \\n - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents \\n - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for \"national security\" \\n - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps. Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. \\n \\n\\nThe Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK.\\n\\nMr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough. The plans would help achieve a \"substantial reduction\" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure. He said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current \"unfair and inhumane\" system.\\n\\n\"We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum,\" Mr Howard said. \"By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.\"\\n\\nBut the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans \"dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible\". Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.\\n\\nHe did not think Mr Howard intended to centre the debate about race. But he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. Mr Howard called that suggestion \"disgraceful\".',\n",

The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. The information commissioner\\'s office says surveys are allowed but there is a \"grey\" area if personal data is kept. Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.\\n\\nBut seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications.\\n\\nThe rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. But that did not happen for \"voter identification\" calls. \"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,\" he said. \"So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service.\"\\n\\nHe said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers. She said: \"We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do things that are not allowed in the law.\" A spokesman for the Information Commissioner\\'s Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person. \"If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,\" he said.\\n\\nThe spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. The spokesman said there was \"no yes or no\" answer and the area was \"pretty grey\". He added: \"If someone complained, then we would investigate that. Political parties are aware of the regulations. At the last by-elections, we reminded them.\" Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: \"The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal.\" He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are \"significant\" numbers of such calls. \"I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,\" he tells the commissioner. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.',\n",

He said: \"I hope I\\'m not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people\\'s health and their ability to control what\\'s happening round about them.\" Mr McConnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking. \"The one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that,\" he said. \"Far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. \"We are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.\"\\n\\nHe added: \"By all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly.\" SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said: \"This is an incredible gaffe by Jack McConnell. \"We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk. \"The first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately.\" But an executive spokeswoman insisted Mr McConnell had made the remark with adults, not youngsters, in mind. \"He was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s,\" she said. \"It was just a recognition that people will get drunk, but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.\"',\n",

But the chancellor said Mr Baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. He said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members\\' jobs. It suited the purpose of Mr Baume\\'s union, the First Division Association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n\\nUnder the plans, unveiled in the Gershon report, some 84,000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services. Mr Brown said: \"To be honest I don\\'t think you can rely on his [Mr Baume\\'s] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. \"Mr Blair and I are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms. We are determined to go on with the Gershon reforms.\" He also said that as Mr Baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge. On Wednesday, ahead of the Chancellor\\'s pre-Budget report, Mr Baume told BBC News there were sometimes \"conflicting and competing agendas for government\" between Number 10 and the Treasury.\\n\\nWhat the chancellor wanted was \"not by any means what Alan Milburn and the prime minister want to see\", Mr Baume said. \"Government departments get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that\\'s not necessarily the same as the Treasury\\'s and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. \"He also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda. \"The problem is that on many occasions these two don\\'t add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle.\" Number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a \"soap opera\" about Mr Blair and Mr Brown. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"The battle Royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and Tony Blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money.\"',\n",

Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers.

If Wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more MPs. Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. \"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers?\" he said. Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: \"This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people\\'s lives by reducing the size and role of the State\".\\n\\nMr Howard said the plan would also even out the \"great unfairness\" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England. The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said. In Northern Ireland it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000. The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was \"consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom\" if the assembly was scrapped.

The move follows a Law Lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison, London, and Woodhill, Milton Keynes, was unlawful. The 12 affected by the ruling are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.\\n\\nMr Clarke told The Times: \"I think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.\" He said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw \"in a very positive way\". Mr Clarke said that he was seeking \"memorandums of understanding\" between overseas governments and Britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. However, he added: \"I do not think the solution to the Law Lords\\' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. \"There are other strands that we have to do.\" But the Liberal Democrat\\'s shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.\\n\\n\"The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,\" he told BBC News. \"And I do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included,\" Mr Oaten said. \"Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.\" \"Unless we get that, the Liberal Democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in March.\"\\n\\nThe BBC\\'s home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett.

Deputy Health Minister Rhona Brankin has pledged to study the research. SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.\\n\\nThe rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the \"care development group\" of Scottish Executive experts who prepared the original costings, according to findings published in the Quarterly Economic Commentary of Strathclyde University\\'s Fraser of Allander Institute. \"Dubious\" assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022, the report warned.\\n\\nIt was carried out by husband and wife economist team Jim and Margaret Cuthbert.

He is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring \"radically improved\" public services. He is also claiming Labour is more ideologically united than ever. Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.\\n\\nWith the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity. Now Mr Blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of Labour\\'s platform for a third term in government.

In it he alleges that Mr Blair told Mr Brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. The book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him. Mr Peston\\'s book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\" On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\"',\n",

Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. The home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not \"well informed\". Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.\\n\\nHe said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002. Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam. But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead. Mr Mubanga said the \"MI6 agent\" told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission. Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.\\n\\nHis lawyer Louise Christian said: \"\\'We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo.\" And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats\\' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga\\'s transfer to Guantanamo. But a Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of British intelligence or security agencies. And Home Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost: \"I\\'m not organising a specific investigation into it.\" Mr Mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. He told the Observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last March, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.\\n\\nHe claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts. And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: \"I\\'ve lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim. He added: \"The authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. They\\'ve made me what I am - even if I\\'m not quite sure yet who that person is.\" The US government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture. In a statement, it said: \"The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. \"He was detained to prevent him from fighting against the US and our allies in the war on terror.\" But Fair Trials Abroad director Stephen Jakobi said there were similarities between Mr Mubanga\\'s account and those of other Guantanamo detainees. He said: \"The pattern is the same. The real problem is the concentration camp conditions in Guantanamo. \"Is [Charles Clarke] really pretending this is all made up?\" Mr Mubanga and the three other freed British detainees were released without charge by UK police on their return from Cuba.',\n",

The £3.2bn settlement includes the \"full\" £7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition, £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was \"confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.\" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that \"significant\" cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed. \"A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems,\" said Mr Wellington. \"It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.\" On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds. Ms Essex said: \"I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. \"I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.\" She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, \"even for those people who have moved up a band\".\\n\\nThe settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said: \"This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.\" Plaid Cymru\\'s local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement \"hugely disappointing\". He said: \"Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger.\" \"This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both.\" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said: \"I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.\" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change \"is taking spin to the very verge of deception\". He added: \"Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.\"',\n",

About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.\\n\\nMs Hodge said: \"Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. \"We need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. \"Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity.\" The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.\\n\\nFostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system. \"There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. \"And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it\\'s not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets.\" The charity recommends a weekly payment of £108.49 for looking after a baby. In a survey, it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as £100 per week.\\n\\nThe Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it agreed in principle with the government\\'s plans. Tony Hunter, the organisation\\'s president, said: \"There are many devils and lots of details hidden within the Government\\'s proposals. \"But ADSS fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges.\"',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Royal couple watch nation\\'s mood\\n\\nPrince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation\\'s reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.\\n\\nMrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple\\'s decision to marry. But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.\\n\\nThe poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: \"I\\'m just coming down to earth.\" She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters. Charles said he and his wife-to-be were \"absolutely delighted\". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.\\n\\nThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them \"very happy\". Princes William and Harry said they are \"very happy\" and wish the couple \"all the luck in the future\". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George\\'s Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.\\n\\nThe marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. \"His divorce from Diana and the disappointment the country felt over how Diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince Charles],\" said Ros Coward, who wrote the authorised biography of Diana, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: \"I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step.\" Tony Blair said he was \"delighted\" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. Australia\\'s Prime Minister John Howard also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a \"sensible and a good thing\". Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince\\'s Trust. Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.',\n",

Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player. Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week. During the same quarter, Yahoo earned $187m, again tipping a resurgence in online advertising.\\n\\nThe trend has taken hold relatively quickly. Late last year, marketing company Doubleclick, one of the leading providers of online advertising, warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale. But on Thursday, it announced that a sharp turnaround had brought about an unexpected increase in profits. Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however. In both cases, their shares fell by some 4%. Analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters, fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of Google on Tuesday.\",\n",

But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. Millions of people were left homeless in Indonesia Aceh\\'s region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December.\\n\\nIndonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down.

Since President Yudhoyono\\'s government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. \"The (January to March) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices,\" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, State Minister for National Development Planning. \"We are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. The sooner the better for the state budget.\" The BBC\\'s correspondent in Jakarta, Rachel Harvey, told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. \"The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,\" she said. Indonesia\\'s previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.',\n",

The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.\\n\\nIn January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.\",\n",

Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n\\nPearson\\'s Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n\\nThe National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\\n\\nSome broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\\n\\nThe Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black\\'s Hollinger International.

They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike.

              " {'sequence': 'Air passengers win new EU rights\\n\\nAir passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.\\n\\nNew EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a \"bad piece of legislation\". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.\\n\\nHowever, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.\\n\\nThe EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to \\'bumping\\' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger\\'s will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.\\n\\nHowever, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to \"extraordinary circumstances\". Airlines fear that \"extraordinary circumstances\" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. \"It\\'s a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n\\nThe European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.\\n\\nEC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were \"grey areas\" but said \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out\". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA\\'s Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. \"We reckon it\\'s going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that\\'s over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,\" Mr Clarke said. \"That\\'s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. \"The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers\\' right.\" \"This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people\\'s daily lives,\" he added. The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.',\n",

There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China\\'s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China\\'s yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect.

Its brands, well-known in Italy and overseas, have continued to perform strongly, however, and have barely lost revenue since the scandal broke.\\n\\nBut a crucial factor for the company's future is the legal unwinding of its intensely complex financial position.

That brought to 49 the number of banks that Mr Bondi has sued, a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros.

              " {'sequence': 'Call centre users \\'lose patience\\'\\n\\nCustomers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.\\n\\nOnce past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an \\'always available\\' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling \\'on the move\\' using their mobile phones.\\n\\nThe surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres\\' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.\\n\\nIn what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer\\'s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.\\n\\nSuggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.\\n\\nThere are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:\\n\\n- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", \\n - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, \\n - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?',\n",

Advisors Goldman Sachs are understood to have valued its demerged Deluxe Film unit at £300m, the report added. Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September. Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios. The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.\\n\\nRank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. It also owns Deluxe Media, which makes and distributes DVDs and videos. However, that business is seen as less successful. Last year it made profits of £21.5m on a turnover of £392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to DVDs from VHS video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. A spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on Friday. Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to £170m from £194m last year. Formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading UK film producer and cinema owner for many years. It has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the UK - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. It now owns 34 Grosvenor casinos, the Mecca Bingo chain and more than 100 Hard Rock Cafes in 38 countries.\",\n",

The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n\\nMr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. \"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees,\" he told a Russian court.\\n\\nYugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.\\n\\nTexas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. \"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,\" Judge Clark said in her ruling. \"Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government.\" Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.\\n\\nIn her ruling, the judge acknowledged that \"it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law\".

The US court\\'s jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft.

This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\\n\\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall.

Analysts said that economic conditions were benign and Irish shares were still trading at a discount to other European markets. \"Ireland ticks all the boxes as far as international investors are concerned,\" Roy Asher, chief investment officer of Hibernian Investment Managers, told Reuters. \"Buoyant economic conditions are set to continue in Ireland over the next few years and Irish equities continue to offer quality growth at a reasonable valuation.\"\\n\\nBernard McAlinden, head of equity research at NCB Stockbrokers, said equities represented good value compared to other investments. \"It is still looking good,\" he told Reuters. \"We have seen good economic data on Ireland which benefits the financial stocks.\" Ireland\\'s economic \\'miracle\\' is enjoying a second wind, with 5% growth forecast for 2005 and 2006. The economy cooled markedly between 2001 and 2003 after enjoying spectacular growth of more than 10% in 2000. However, it has bounced back strongly with growth of just under 5% expected in 2004.',\n",

Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. The new rules are the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, part of the US clean-up after corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom. Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules.

They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some, particularly the UK\\'s CBI, warned that companies would choose to let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404.

The European Union, in particular, was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted. \"I don\\'t underestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension will provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look at their internal controls,\" said Donald Nicolaisen, the SEC\\'s chief accountant.',\n",

His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\\n\\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan\\'s most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country\\'s leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\\n\\nMr Tsutsumi\\'s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn\\'t let me use the silk futon, saying it\\'s a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan\\'s troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank\\'s bad loans.',\n",

While the US economy is growing at a \"reasonably good pace\" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US.

If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,\" Mr Greenspan said. He also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity \"retirement and health programmes would need \"significant\" changes. He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.\\n\\nMeanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs.

              " {'sequence': 'Japan economy slides to recession\\n\\nThe Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.\\n\\nGross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters. The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. On Wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips Japan into recession.\\n\\nA previous estimate of 0.1% growth between July and September was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.\\n\\nFigures released by the government\\'s Cabinet Office showed that GDP, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. However, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. \"The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,\" said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka. Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. \"The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone,\" Mr Takenaka stressed.\\n\\nMinisters pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan\\'s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. Japan\\'s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. However, the economy\\'s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. \"The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn\\'t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,\" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. Japan\\'s economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.',\n",

The gains tracked a surge in US gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon. The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company\\'s refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production. A spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running. \"This market simply wants to go up,\" Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency. Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: \"Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast.\"\\n\\nElsewhere, a refinery in Houston was closed due to mechanical problems, while on Tuesday production at BP\\'s Texas City refinery was taken down for a short time. In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. The rise in prices came despite a US government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec\\'s recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. Instability in Iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played a part in the rally.',\n",

Japan\\'s government remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand.\\n\\nAnalysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output.\\n\\nAccording to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions.

Experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. \"The outlook for November is positive so I don\\'t think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in October,\" said a METI official. Despite the rise in unemployment, jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years.

The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday\\'s announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production.\\n\\nSince its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.\\n\\nLast year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,\" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"The risk is that after they\\'ve invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,\" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.\\n\\nThe price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from £12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker\\'s. The consumers\\' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.\\n\\nThe Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.\\n\\nThere are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW\\'s Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory\\'s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.',\n",

However, Nestle\\'s profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\\n\\nNestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream. Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.\\n\\nElsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth.

Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together, it said. Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat's car business is making a loss.\\n\\nUnder the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. It considered floating Ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to Italian bank Mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). That sale valued Ferrari - which owns the Maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. Such a move would help Alfa Romeo and Maserati to share marketing, distribution and research & development costs. Maserati and Ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.\\n\\nFiat, Italy's largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes. Fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with General Motors. The US firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy Fiat outright.

Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. Also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 GMT.\\n\\nThe government has been accused of underfunding R&D, making it harder for Italy to compete with other European nations and leading to a \"brain-drain\" of the country\\'s brightest talents. Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. As a result, they say, Italy\\'s corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. At the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy\\'s entrepreneurial spirit.\\n\\nThe government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy\\'s 60 million population. According to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy\\'s business newspaper, the government will focus on \"opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system\".\\n\\nMr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; £4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. He has also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. Italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility Enel. Critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make Italy\\'s problems worse. Limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.\\n\\nThe country has been one of the eurozone\\'s worst economic performers in recent years. Growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. At the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from Italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy\\'s economy to a juddering halt. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy\\'s economy.',\n",

The tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; £910m). Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. Spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. All the spending increases will run over the next three years.\\n\\nUnveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%.\\n\\nHe predicted that the South African economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. Mr Manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.\\n\\n\"In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,\" said Mr Manuel. He said that the economic situation was a \"marked improvement\" on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. About 280,000 jobs a year have been created in South Africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high, currently close to 30%. Economist Colen Garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth. \"It\\'s pleasant to see the cut in company taxes, it\\'s a good incentive for business,\" he said.',\n",

Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\\n\\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\\n\\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\\n\\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year\\'s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"',\n",

The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\\n\\n\"We\\'re surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February\\'s Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\\n\\nGermany\\'s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany\\'s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.',\n",

As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\\n\\nThe FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries\\' access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\\n\\nAccording to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. These countries are mainly situated in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.',\n",

Analysts say improving India\\'s infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. The Indian government\\'s decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms.\\n\\nA spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean \"better offerings\" for consumers as well as builders. He said the firm will benefit from world class \"strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumers will have better choice.\"\\n\\nThe government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the \\'automatic route\\' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. The automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which can be bureaucratic. The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries.\\n\\nMr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. \"Foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,\" said Mr Nath, without specifying the timeframe. Previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market. This measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. Anshuman Magazine, managing director, of CB Richard Ellis - an international real estate company - told the BBC this was \"a big positive step.\"\\n\\nHowever, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said allowing FDI in the country is compromising India\\'s own \"self reliance\". He said, \"No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.\" Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.',\n",

Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.\\n\\nAnalysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world\\'s airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.\\n\\nIt is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing\\'s twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\\n\\n\"Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. But the 777-200LR \"is a niche player\", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.\\n\\nFor Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. It has been producing a rival to Boeing\\'s 777 line for more than a year. \"Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said Flight International\\'s Mr Learmount.\\n\\nBoth Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. These orders should help underpin the company\\'s profits. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract. Net profit was $186m (£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.',\n",

Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. Other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health. Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December. Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003.

It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward.

The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China\\'s CNPC.\\n\\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk\\'s former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\\n\\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk.

Once the country\\'s richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n\\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China\\'s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China\\'s thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it\\'s a good deal for them too.\"',\n",

GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Monday\\'s 4% gain on hopes of a payoff.

Yukos argued that since it had a US subsidiary and local bank accounts, the US court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of Yugansk. But Deutsche Bank - itself a target of a Yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank\\'s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in Houston. Its lawyer, Hugh Ray, told the court that Yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts opened by its new US subsidiary. By doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts. But he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after Yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 December, and then backdated.\\n\\nYukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point. He said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork, but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 December. Even so, he told the court that only $480,000 had been in the accounts that day, with the rest arriving a day later.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm Gazprom the money to bid for Yuganskneftegaz, as the Yukos unit is formally known. The sale went ahead, despite an order from the US bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. In the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm Rosneft. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia\\'s very profitable oil business back under state control.\\n\\nYukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia. It also said that in the event of going bust, it could offer the chance of restructuring. \"It gives us a kind of life after death alternative,\" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. Yukos is currently suing four companies - Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, Rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in Yugansk\\'s disposal. It has also threatened to sue the Russian government for $28bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos\\' legal wrangling as meaningless. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

              " {'sequence': 'French wine gets 70m euro top-up\\n\\nThe French government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction.\\n\\nThe financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed. The French wine industry, the world\\'s second largest, has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of New World wines. Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough. The package was announced by agriculture minister Dominique Bussereau after talks with vintners\\' representatives.\\n\\nThe bulk of the money - about 40m euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments. A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of French producers, in low interest loans. Efforts to promote French wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding. France fell behind the \\'New World\\' producers of Australia, Chile and the United States for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports.\\n\\nDomestic consumption, accounting for 70% of sales, has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws.\\n\\nThe aid package would \"create a positive climate around French viticulture,\" Mr Bussereau said. However, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. \"I am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions,\" Jean-Michel Lemetayer, from the FNSEA agricultural union, told the Associated Press news agency. In an effort to tackle overcapacity, the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent, while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement. The government will also seek European Union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation. Production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%. The support is designed to make French producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry. Wine makers in France\\'s best-known regions, such as Burgundy, have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers.',\n",

Russia\\'s reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant Yukos. S&P said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk. Russia is now a net creditor rather than a debtor.

S&P had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms. Now, though, it has finally followed suit. But the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past. Instead, with Russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales, S&P said the government\\'s own debt is looking a good bet. \"These improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on Russia,\" wrote S&P credit analyst Helena Hessel.\\n\\nThe Yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which Ms Hessel alludes. The company\\'s founder and ex-chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud.

Turkcell\\'s financial consolidation of Irancell\" because its stake would be reduced to less than 50%. \"If management control and financial consolidation of Irancell cannot be achieved... the realisation of the project will become risky,\" it warned in a statement. The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel, although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there. The two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004. Israeli industry minister Ehud Olmert was reported in June to have attended a meeting between Ruhi Dogusoy, Turkcell\\'s chief operating officer, and executives from Israeli telecoms firms. Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments, passed earlier in September. The other is airports, a source of controversy after the army closed Tehran\\'s new Imam Khomeini International Airport on its opening day in May 2004.

Argentina defaulted on its debt three years ago, the biggest sovereign default in modern history. Yesterday Argentina\\'s economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, said that he estimated that the results of the restructuring would be ready around next Thursday (3 March). Argentina\\'s President, Nestor Kirchner, said on Friday: \"A year ago when we started the swap (negotiations), they told us we were crazy, that we were irrational.\" But he added that his government was close to achieving: \"The best debt renegotiation in history.\" The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years. If the offer does not go ahead, international lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved investors could follow but analysts are optimistic that it will go through, despite the tough terms for bondholders. About 70% to 80% of bondholders are expected to accept the terms of the offer. By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer. Sorting out its debt would enhance the country\\'s credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment. Of Argentina\\'s bondholders, 38.4% reside in Argentina, 15.6% in Italy, 10.3% in Switzerland, 9.1% in the United States, 5.1% in Germany and 3.1% in Japan. Investors in the UK, Holland and Luxembourg have about 1% each and the remainder were not broken down by country.

They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush\\'s administration had done little to stop the dollar\\'s slide. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November. Against the Japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.\\n\\nPolicy makers in Europe have called the dollar\\'s slide \"brutal\" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. However, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro\\'s rise at a monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday. Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of a four-nation EU visit, has applauded Ireland\\'s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. \"The eurozone is growing below its potential. When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,\" he said. Mr Snow\\'s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.\\n\\n\"Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,\" he explained. \"Markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.\" US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. Domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by President Bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (£230bn). The current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. For many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. \"No end is in sight,\" said Carsten Fritsch, a strategist at Commerzbank . \"It is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.\" Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.',\n",

              "{'sequence': 'Australia rates at four year high\\n\\nAustralia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country\\'s economy.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year. However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.\\n\\nThe rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.\\n\\nThe figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations. Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. \"Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,\" said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.\\n\\nAt 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank\\'s 2-3% target range. However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country\\'s current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn. The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low. \"The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn\\'t look to me like it\\'s slowing in any unreasonable way,\" said Treasurer Peter Costello. Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy. \"That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1,\" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \"This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.\"',\n",

At the time, Titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in Benin. There is no suggestion that Mr Kerekou was himself aware of any wrongdoing. Titan, a California-based company, pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating US anti-bribery laws. It agreed to pay $13m in criminal penalties, as well as $15.5m to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\n\\nThe SEC had accused Titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in Benin claiming ties with President Kerekou. Some of the money was used to pay for T-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election. Shortly after the poll, which Mr Kerekou won, Benin officials agreed to quadruple Titan\\'s management fee. Prosecuting attorney Carol Lam said: \"All US companies should take note that attempting to bribe foreign officials is criminal conduct and will be appropriately prosecuted.\" The company says it no longer tolerates such practices. Under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, it is a crime for American firms to bribe foreign officials.',\n",
